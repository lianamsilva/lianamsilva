My article, &#8221;This Is How You Read An Audiobook: A Close Listen of Junot Díaz’s *This Is How You Lose Her*,” analyzed how having an author read his own book can change how readers interpret the book. I aimed to do what I called a &#8220;close listening&#8221; of the audiobook instead of writing about the book on its own. I submitted this article to *The Velvet Light Trap* in August 2013.
