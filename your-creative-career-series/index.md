At *Chronicle Vitae* I started <a href="https://chroniclevitae.com/news/855-your-creative-career-part-1" target="_blank">a new series of articles about creative people who go into higher education or stay to work in academia</a>. In the series IÂ want to consider how graduate programs are training their students, through the anecdotes of a population that may or may not have a clearly defined career path. Many columnists have attempted to answer the question of what you can do with a degree in the humanities. I wonder, why do creative types pick the majors they pick and why do they stick around for graduate school?

For the series I will be interviewing writers, artists, and thinkers &#8212; creators &#8212; and asking about how they got to where they are now. More important, I will be discussing questions like: What did you get out of graduate school? Did it take you away from your creativity, or did it bring you closer to what you hoped to do with your work? I also hope to explore the broader question of whether we need better advising, better advertising, or both.
