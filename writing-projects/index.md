Inspired by Michelle Moravec&#8217;s project [Writing In Public][4] (which you can follow along on Twitter via the hashtag [#writinginpublic][5]), I am posting here links to drafts of works in progress. I believe that making the writing process visible to others can make academic writing less daunting. This is my intention by listing and explaining the current projects I&#8217;m working on.
