Presentation abstract:

<p dir="ltr">
  I will talk about the idea of the writing center as a safe space where students can ask the questions about writing (not necessarily about the content) that many faculty members assume their students already know. I will also address how writing centers and faculty members can work together to help students succeed in their graduate careers.
