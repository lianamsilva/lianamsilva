**I like to write.**

As far as I can remember, I&#8217;ve enjoyed writing. I also like to share what I write with others. For a while I&#8217;ve blogged at other locations (like [here][1], where I post more academic, research-driven work regularly or [here][2] where I talk about what it&#8217;s like to write a dissertation) and [tweeted][3] like it&#8217;s no one&#8217;s business, until I decided to start blogging regularly [at my own blog][4]. My desire to write was the reason why I decided to become an English major in the first place. After years of writing to fulfill requirements, I am writing because I want to. And now, I get to work with other writers on a regular basis.

I&#8217;m a *developmental editor. *I&#8217;ve worked mostly with academics, but I&#8217;m happy to work with all kinds of writers too. I consider myself a cheerleader, a voice of reason, a sounding board, a devil&#8217;s advocate, and a wordsmith. I help writers figure out where all those ideas in their head are going. You can read <a href="http://www.lianamsilvaford.com/?page_id=12" target="_blank">more about that here.</a> You can also read my bio at <a href="http://www.academiccoachingandwriting.org/about-acw/our-coaches/" target="_blank"><em>Academic Coaching and Writing</em></a>.

I&#8217;m a *blogger. *I have my own blog, <a href="http://blog.lianamsilvaford.com/" target="_blank"><em>Words Are My Game</em></a>. I also blog at other venues online; I keep a log of those posts [on this page][5].

I&#8217;m a *writer*. I started working on a book on postcards. I keep a Tumblr of my postcard collection <a href="http://noenvelopeneeded.tumblr.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

As of December 2013, I am the new *Ed**itor* for the newsletter <a href="http://wihe.com/" target="_blank"><em>Women in Higher Education</em></a>.
