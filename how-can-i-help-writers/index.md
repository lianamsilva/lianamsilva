**Writing is a solitary endeavor.Â **Or so we&#8217;re told.

In reality, a lot goes into a piece of writing: conversations, questions, edits, revisions, walks in the park, thoughts in the shower, random conversations with someone who has nothing to do with your topic&#8230;you get where I&#8217;m going. Writing benefits not just from multiple drafts but also from multiple readers/readings.

That&#8217;s where I come in.

I can help [on the support front][1]. I can also help [with the editing][2].
