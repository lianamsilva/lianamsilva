**I think deep thoughts about academic writing so you don&#8217;t have to.**

For years I have worked with academic writers from all over the higher ed spectrum. I have read, I have asked questions, I have made notes, I have outlined half-baked arguments, and I have given writers the helping hand they needed to finish their article/book/dissertation.

**I&#8217;m a developmental editor.**

That means I help writers develop their ideas. I don&#8217;t write their articles. I don&#8217;t do their research. I don&#8217;t take their article and change it two weeks later. I coach their ideas out of knots and into straight lines. I have a keen eye and ear for what writers want to say. *I read the drafts no one wants to read&#8211;or has the patience to read.* I also pride myself on asking the questions writers might not remember to ask anymore&#8230;or that they didn&#8217;t know they should ask in the first place.

I also help writers get back into their writing groove. Whether it means weekly check-ins, a regular email with word counts, or a monthly writing plan, I do what it takes to help writers get it done. I create the safe space where they can try and try again until it comes out just right.

It goes a little something like this:Â *Writer vents about article.* I take notes. *Writer asks question.* I make magic out of scribbles. *We both celebrate.*
