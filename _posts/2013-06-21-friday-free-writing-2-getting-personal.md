I now have a name for my Friday series on writing questions/queries/quandries: **Friday Free Writing**. Just thought of it this morning as I was getting ready to go to daycare. (Inspiration strikes in the weirdest places; I just let it happen.)

So for today I&#8217;m riffing off of a conversation I had earlier this week with one of my tweeps about inserting &#8220;I&#8221;/ourselves in our writing. The use of &#8220;I&#8221; in academic writing is especially fraught. As a first-year composition instructor, I dealt week in and week out with the same question:

&#8220;Can I use &#8216;I&#8217; in my paper?&#8221;

My gut reaction: &#8220;Of course you can!&#8221;

My maasured, professorial reaction: &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s think about this for a second&#8230;&#8221;

My gut reaction (*&#8220;Of course you can!&#8221;*) stems from the fact that I believe we can&#8217;t separate what we write from our selves. However, my measured, professorial reaction (*&#8220;Let think about this&#8221;*) stems from the fact that **writers** (not just students) need to understand what some of the guidelines of the writing game are before they go and do their own thing. Here is how I would break it down to my student-writers:

**♦Using &#8220;I&#8221; in academic writing is generally frowned upon, yes.** That is a very traditional notion of academic writing. You probably heard it in high school, and you&#8217;ve probably heard it from other professors/academics. However, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t make sense to talk in passive voice or to pretend you&#8217;re talking about someone else (or worse, a general population) when you&#8217;re clearly talking about your point of view or something that happened to you. So go ahead and add it if it feels like the sentence doesn&#8217;t make sense without it.

<strong style="font-size: 16px;">♦Avoid the &#8220;I think/I feel/I believe&#8221; trap.</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Sometimes the first thing that pops in your head when writing is &#8220;I think that&#8221; or &#8220;I feel that.&#8221; Sometimes it&#8217;s warranted to underscore how you think or feel about the matter. But sometimes, depending on the genre, it&#8217;s obvious that what you&#8217;re writing is how you feel about a topic. So, during revision (that&#8217;s why we need drafts, folks!) highlight the passages where you use &#8220;I think&#8221;/&#8221;I feel&#8221;/&#8221;I believe.&#8221; Cut them out </span><em style="font-size: 16px;">just for argument&#8217;s sake</em><span style="font-size: 16px;">. Read the passage without it. Does it sound the same? It probably does. So leave it like that.</span>

<strong style="font-size: 16px;">♦Think about your audience.</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Remember when I talked about &#8220;writing guidelines&#8221; above? I don&#8217;t like saying &#8220;writing rules&#8221; because it sounds like These Are The Rules and no one can do anything different. I prefer &#8220;guidelines&#8221; because it lends itself to the flexible nature of writing. This applies to using &#8220;I&#8221; in your writing. I told my students again and again, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s great if you use &#8216;I&#8217; in your essay. But be aware that some professors don&#8217;t like that AT ALL.&#8221; So, say, if your audience for a certain piece is your professor, keep in mind if they dislike it when writers use &#8220;I.&#8221; If you&#8217;re writing for a trade publication, would that seem reasonable? More importantly, </span><em style="font-size: 16px;">why </em><span style="font-size: 16px;">are you using &#8220;I&#8221; in the first place?</span>

I know, you probably came here looking for clear-cut answers, and here I go telling you to think about why you use &#8220;I.&#8221; But the truth is, writing is about the choices we make. The best guideline you can use in writing is to think about why you use the words/language you are using to convey something. You&#8217;re making choices far more often than you give yourself credit for.

**Before I go, for funsies:** I was looking for something funny online about using the pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; in your writing, but that failed. Instead, I&#8217;m sharing a new blog I discovered this week and that I like a lot; I enjoy it because of the quality of the information and because of the tone in which it is written. Enjoy [AP vs. Chicago][1]
