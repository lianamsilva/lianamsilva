    Over the years, I have developed a writing habit. Or, maybe, the inclination was already there and I just needed to tap into it, pop open the lid, and let it overflow. But writing has become the way I digest the world around me. Whether it&#8217;s the diary I kept as a teenager, the dissertation I handed in last May, or the notes to self I add to my <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> notebooks, writing is my way to think through problems, ideas, questions. And I do this on a regular basis so that I don&#8217;t lose those loose threads of thought. My life is so busy nowadays, and I don&#8217;t have the luxury of spending whole days writing. I have trained myself to write regularly and write in bite-sized bursts.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you read this blog regularly, you know I <a href="http://wordsaremygame.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/finding-my-niche/">work with graduate student writers</a> and help them work toward their writing goals. When I work with graduate students, I try not to just offer suggestions (Here&#8217;s a laundry list of things you could do to finish this dissertation) but to also help them understand what&#8217;s at the root of their writing woes. (Why can&#8217;t you get past chapter 1? What is keeping you from starting your introduction? Why have you been stalled for years on the same project?) I&#8217;d like to think my training as a humanities scholar trained me to think in such deep ways about the questions students bring to me, but I also think it has to do with the fact that, deep down, I enjoy talking about writing, and I enjoy writing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (<a href="http://wordsaremygame.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/my-fear-of-commitment/">This wasn&#8217;t always the case</a>. But I digress&#8230;)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One of the suggestions I offer my students is to write every day, or at least every day. Some think that&#8217;s crazy talk. Some feel overwhelmed just thinking about it. Some think it works for others but wouldn&#8217;t work for them. Many invoke the specter of &#8220;inspiration,&#8221; that inspiration will hit at some point and that conference paper will emerge out of thin air.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you think of writing as only the polished, organized, ready-to-wear kind of writing that you can publish right out of the bag, then yeah. You can&#8217;t do that every day. But if you think about writing in all of its different shapes and forms, you just might do it every day&#8230;or at least on a regular basis.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although I recognize that <a href="http://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/10/17/why-writing-from-day-one-is-nuts/">the &#8220;write every day&#8221; may not work for some</a>, trying it won&#8217;t hurt anyone. Part of the resistance comes from assumptions about what &#8220;writing&#8221; entails. That made me think: maybe I should explain <a href="http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/celebrate-the-national-day-on-writing-by-posting-whatiwrite-messages-on-twitter/">#whatiwrite</a> when I write every day. Here it goes:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      notes (to self, mostly).
    </li>
    <li>
      ideas. I jam them into Evernote, and put them in a particular notebook. I also have a Word doc I share with my writing buddy, and put there random things I&#8217;ve been thinking about, related to my research, my blog posts, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Comments on articles, and not just the academic kind.
    </li>
    <li>
      questions. Usually things I&#8217;m wondering about.
    </li>
    <li>
      quotations. Something that struck me.
    </li>
    <li>
      things to do.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Of course I do all sorts of other writing throughout the day, for example for work, but this is the kind of writing connected to my academic career. I see writing as tied to my academic persona, and as an alternative academic I find that my writing gives credibility to the fact that the research side of my brain is always in motion. In a way, writing has become the way I keep the research gears in my heard turning. Writing is how I stay relevant.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But, aside from the career implications, writing feels good. Writing is a reminder I am alive.
