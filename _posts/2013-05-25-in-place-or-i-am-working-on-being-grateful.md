  If you only knew: I usually resist making my posts too personal, but sometimes that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s on my mind. Like now. It seems every time I sat down to write it this past week, it just came out looking like a diary entry. I&#8217;m sure it has all to do with where I am, mentally, right now. Physically I&#8217;m in Houston. (Finally.) I&#8217;m liking my new city so far, but this isn&#8217;t about Houston. Mentally, I&#8217;m at this weird point in the road where it&#8217;s kind of foggy and i&#8217;m not sure where i&#8217;m headed&#8211;<em>career-wise</em>&#8211;so I&#8217;m taking one step at a time.

    In reality, what I want to do is hurry up and chart my new life in Texas, i.e., hurry up and get a job. Being forced to take things one step at a time is an odd place to be because I like to have a clear head as to where I am headed and what this all leads to. I think I might have mentioned before&#8211;and if you don&#8217;t know, now you know&#8211;that one of the reasons I was attracted to being a tenure-track professor was because I liked the idea of a clear path from degree to job. Maybe it&#8217;s the careerist in me that&#8217;s panicking. Maybe it&#8217;s my OCD tendencies. Maybe it&#8217;s just what I am used to, what&#8217;s safe.

  <em>This feels like uncharted territory.</em></p> 
  
  <div>

  <div>
    And so I feel like I can&#8217;t just let go and enjoy this in-between time, really. I worry about getting a job, even though I&#8217;m working on that. I worry about not paying bills, even though I know we&#8217;re covered in that department. I worry about whether I should commit to freelancing or not. And really, I should just enjoy this moment. When was the last time I could wake up whenever I wanted? Write whenever I wanted? Read whatever I wanted? This is actually a pretty good gig. And yet, somehow, part of me feels like I can&#8217;t sit back and just be. Weird.</p>

    <div>
      I need to just be and take one day at a time. I need to realize that I am working towards employment. I need to realize that we&#8217;ve had some tough financial times and that now <em>I&#8217;m in a good place</em>. I&#8217;m in a better place than I was before. Heck. I&#8217;m in a better place than I have ever been. (Being broke has a way of re-wiring your brain so that you&#8217;re always worried about how you&#8217;re going to get by the next week.)</p>

        So I will write. I will read. I will take walks. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/literarychica/">I will photograph</a>. I will hang out with my family. And I will tell myself to not feel weird about not heading out to the office any time soon.</p>

          In the meantime, I will work on my new website. It&#8217;s somewhere out there on the Internet. You just can&#8217;t find it yet.</p>
