Finally&#8230;I have returned. It&#8217;s good to be back!

This Saturday I submitted Chapter 3 of my dissertation. I actually emailed it to my advisor late in the afternoon, and having it done way before midnight is such a great feeling. After weeks of freaking out over how I was going to finish this chapter in time, after tossing out of the window my weekly schedule and forcing myself to just sit down and write, I finally finished.The chapter is done, and I can breathe.

    My trusty hard copy MLA Handbook
  </p>
</div>

As I pulled out on Saturday morning  my copy of the [MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers][1] (I still rely on the Handbook instead of the [MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing][2], goes to show you how old school I am), a familiar feeling washed over me: &#8220;I am almost done.&#8221; Taking out the manual to format my citations and Works Cited list is not just part of the process of scholarly writing; it is a ritual. It is the last step of my writing. Although I am seriously considering using reference management software for my next two chapters (I think I might give [Zotero][3] a shot), the MLA Handbook will always be there at that last step.

Before I could pull out my MLA Handbook though, there was a lot of chaos that led up to that moment. My daughter was diagnosed with bronchitis. My laptop went into a coma. I developed a head cold. It seemed like the universe was conspiring against me, pleading me to tae a break, slow things down. Eventually I had to. Once I finished the rough draft last Monday, I had to take a day to rest and relax because I was starting to feel like I was fraying at the edges. Although I knew I would submit the chapter on time, I wondered how I would get it done.

So I had the weekend to chill out. However, the clock is ticking, and I need to get back to work pronto. You see, I spoke to my advisor over a week ago, and she gave me a deadline for finishing the body of the dissertation (chapters). My deadline is November 27. So, when November 27 rolls around, I will have written five (!) dissertation chapters. It took me a year to finally sit down to write my first five dissertation-worthy pages. (I know I wrote five pages because my mentor told me I needed to sit down, write five pages, and stop stalling.) It took me a year to write something that looked like a first chapter. (During that year I had a baby, packed up my apartment to move to Kansas City, started a new job, and took care of a newborn.) In less than a year I will have written four.

Now, how will I write two chapters in three months? I don’t know. All I know is: a) it has been done before by others before me b) it must be done. See, I have been a graduate student for seven years going on eight. But it wasn&#8217;t until a few weeks ago that I reached my breaking point with grad school life when I had to deal with some paperwork drama. So Frazzled Me told my advisor I needed to finish by next Spring because if not I’d walk away from school. My advisor suggested I finish the draft soon so I can revise and defend next semester. That’s where the November deadline came about.

So, starting today, I’m working on chapter 4, a chapter on photography. This is actually a new chapter, something I didn’t have in mind when I first put together my prospectus. I recently read about [Frank Espada][4], a photographer of the Puerto Rican Diaspora. [Duke University recently received the photographer’s collection][5], so now I’m on the lookout for more info about Espada. My mentor suggested I look at Espada in comparison with [Roy DeCarava][6]. I have a feeling that my approach to this chapter will be different from the other chapters if only because I am less familiar with the subjects of this chapter than I was with the other three. It will be truly a process of discovery, and I’m actually looking forward to it.

At times like this, a song from Cracker comes to mind: &#8220;I see the light at the end of the tunnel now. Someone please tell me it&#8217;s not a train.&#8221; I need more Cracker in my life, seriously.
