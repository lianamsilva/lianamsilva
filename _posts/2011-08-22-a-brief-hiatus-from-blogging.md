As I was reading an article this afternoon for Chapter 3 of my dissertation, I suddenly felt the urge to write a blog post. I suddenly felt the urge to write, and to reach out.

I have a deadline coming up. I&#8217;m supposed to email my advisor a polished draft of Chapter 3 on September 3rd. Even though I have half the chapter written, I still have a lot of work to do between then and now, so I&#8217;ll need to keep away from the blog for a little bit. (I&#8217;m even tweeting less. Me! Of all people!) I will be back Monday, September 5th, with more yummy blog goodness for you.

In the meantime, here&#8217;s a brief synopsis of what I&#8217;ve been up to: the last week I have been a dissertation machine. When I wasn&#8217;t at work or taking care of a visitor we had over at the apartment early in the week, I was writing or editing. At this point I feel like my brain is always moving, always machining. I itch to move on and do something different. I get frustrated. I get tired.

I miss blogging. I miss sitting here and writing, typing, editing. Blogging is different from dissertating, so even though I sit down and type every day, when I blog I&#8217;m in a different frame of mind than when I&#8217;m working on my dissertation. Dare I say that blogging keeps me sane for when I sit down to work on my dissertation. But when I get like this I remind myself this is temporary.

I try to stay focused and hope that September 3rd comes quickly and I can just get this over with. I want my &#8220;Words&#8221; time back.

If you&#8217;re looking for something to read, check out two posts I had published last week on other blogs:

a) My first post for U Venus as a regular contributor (which ran Monday, August 15th): [&#8220;How Do You Define an Academic?&#8221;][1]

b) My guest post for Small Strokes Big Oaks called [&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s Perfect&#8221;][2]

Don&#8217;t be sad. I&#8217;ll be back, soon.
