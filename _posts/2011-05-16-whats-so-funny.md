I am funny. But I wouldn&#8217;t define myself as a funny person, not off the bat.

Case in point: My boyfriend and I are both on Twitter. We are avid Twitterers. On occasion, my boyfriend tweets random stuff I say that he thinks is funny (usually my observations on sporting events because he&#8217;s a sports broadcaster). His tweeps usually respond favorably, at least those who respond. Even though I am sometimes mortified, it makes me smile when people outside of our relationship think it&#8217;s funny. (C&#8217;mon, the man lives with me. We had a child together. We&#8217;ve been together for over four and a half years. He is contractually obliged to indulge me with an occasional laugh, although he thinks he&#8217;s not.) Recently, one of his tweeps commented that I was funny and I should start my own blog. My boyfriend agreed.

This made me stop and think. Because I&#8217;m funny, I should have a blog? Huh. But I already have a blog.

Here&#8217;s the thing: I do think I&#8217;m funny. Sometimes I&#8217;m the only one who gets it, but for the most part I think I&#8217;m at least sort of funny to the right crowd. My sister and I grew up making each other laugh, and to this day that&#8217;s what brings us together: coming up with new jokes or reminiscing about old jokes/funny moments. But when it comes to my writing, most of it is serious, thoughtful, intellectual. It&#8217;s probably because I usually write for an academic audience, or because most of my writing experience is related to academia. That says a lot about academia, but that&#8217;s a whole other story. Now that I&#8217;ve decided to write regularly and not limit myself to academic writing (in hopes of becoming America&#8217;s Next Top Writer for [The New Yorker][1]), this makes me wonder: how will my writing Â change in tone and content?

Rewind to several years ago, when I put together my first online dating profile. I remember putting a lot of time and effort into my profile. Words are an essential part of who I am, and I wanted to make sure my profile was an accurate&#8211;and enticing!&#8211;representation of myself. (This was way before Radioguy and I got together, FYI. And even in that scenario words had a lot to do with us getting together.) A friend of mine, who was also doing the online dating thing, read the draft to give me feedback. What was her biggest peeve, you ask? &#8220;You sound so serious. This is so not the gal I know and hang out with.&#8221;

Where did the funny lady go?!

So in this new blog endeavor (I blog at other places with other folks), I plan on lightening things up from time to time. I am serious, I am thoughtful, I am an intellectual. But damnit, I&#8217;m funny. And my writing, whatever the topic, can be funny too.

Btw, if you didn&#8221;t catch my Scrubs reference&#8230;(fast forward to 7:15)
