  <em>I know this post is going up on Saturday, but I had a good excuse: I had a deadline for my first academic article for a traditional academic journal on Thursday, and my life was on pause until, say, yesterday afternoon. Hopefully this post resonates no matter what day of the week. </em></p>

      For this Friday&#8217;s post I decided to go with something a little less mechanical, something a little more abstract: feeling vulnerable about your writing.
    </p>
    
    <div>
      Some of you may think, &#8220;Oh please, vulnerable? Me? I&#8217;m a good writer. I&#8217;m a productive writer. I&#8217;m a confident writer. Why you gotta be so cliche, Liana?&#8221; It&#8217;s alright. You can keep on reading, even if just out of curiosity. Just make sure you have a back-up browser window open for when you need to pretend you&#8217;re reading something else. I&#8217;ll wait&#8230;</p> 
      
      <div>
        <div>
          <div>
            When it comes to writing, the word &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; means being open to attack or criticism. It also implies being on display. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily translate to feeling like a weak writer; rather, it translates to a fear of being seen, or being heard. Let&#8217;s think this through: some writers will feel nervous about sitting down to write&#8230;this is often called writer&#8217;s block. &#8220;I can&#8217;t write.&#8221; &#8220;I have ideas but I don&#8217;t want to put them down on paper.&#8221; &#8220;I just want it to be good when I put it down on the document.&#8221; This feeling may have its roots in different situations, but part of the fear of writing stems from the fact that ideas in our head seem fluid, open to revision, private. Ideas on a paper or on a screen? Now that feels permanent. Nevermind that you can backspace over that shit or that you can just write it and throw it out. Black words on a white paper? That feels permanent. Also, it feels like you&#8217;d have to own up to whatever ideas you wrote down instead of thinking about it as a form of communication, something that&#8217;s open to tweaking.</p> 
            
            <div>
              <div>
                For academics, it&#8217;s even scarier: we are told that we must read every single thing out there about what we write, that we must know all of the arguments that ever existed on our subject. So the idea of sending something out that&#8217;s well-researched but that hasn&#8217;t uncovered every single seed of the subject freaks us out. Never mind that in this day and age, it&#8217;s difficult to try and completely canvass a subject. Never mind that we may feel differently about a subject five years from now. Other scholars look up your ideas, black words on paper, and put them down for posterity, their black words on their white paper.</p> 
                
                <div>
                  <div>
                    For others, the vulnerability is heightened in this age of social media, where nothing is really hidden online. What if what I post on my blog today is not how I feel about the subject two years from now? Or two weeks from now? That shit&#8217;s online forever. And ever. And ever.</p> 
                    
                    <div>
                      <div>
                        Writing, when seen from that point of view, can be scary as all get out. You share something that was private on a page where it is visible, even if not necessarily public. Words on a page or screen mean you can be subject to the perusal of others&#8211;and sometimes those &#8220;others&#8221; are the critical voices in our head. (Think about that the next time you have to read someone else&#8217;s writing, or when you have to grade them. It took a lot of guts to separate themselves from that text, decide you were trustworthy, and allow you to read that.)</p> 
                        
                        <div>
                          <div>
                            But, how do you get to that point? How do you get to that point where you can be vulnerable, let your guard down, and write&#8211;furthermore, share?</p> 
                            
                            <div>
                              <div>
                                Here are some tips for allowing yourself to write:</p> 
                                
                                <div>
                                  <div>
                                    1) <strong>Hide your writing.</strong> I don&#8217;t mean this as &#8220;hide it in a safety box in a bank&#8221; or something. I mean, create a location where you can put ideas, thoughts, questions that you want to write about. Don&#8217;t think about what these ideas are for yet; just write and put them away. I always tell writers, no one has to read the first draft&#8211;better yet, no one has to read your first attempts at writing about a subject. Creating a space for test-driving can make you comfortable with writing about a subject. It could be sticky notes under a keyboard. It could be a folder in your desktop. It could be the Notes feature on your smartphone or tablet. It could be a notebook that you carry around with you. Whatever it is, make it yours.</p> 
                                    
                                    <div>
                                      <div>
                                        2) <strong>Get used to writing-while-thinking.</strong> Writing goes hand in hand with thinking. Don&#8217;t just write when you&#8217;re ready to write (i.e., read all of the things and know what my argument is). Write when things come to mind. Take out your notebook and write it down. No one has to know. Or maybe you want to tell me and no one else; that&#8217;s cool. I&#8217;m just hanging out at my laptop anyway!</p> 
                                        
                                        <div>
                                          <div>
                                            3) <strong>Get used to talking about your writing.</strong> I know, I know, but I just said that you can write and not show it to anyone. Yes, yes I did. But I didn&#8217;t say you couldn&#8217;t talk to people. So yes, go ahead and talk. That may mean a status update on Facebook, asking someone in class if you can bounce ideas off of them, chatting with a writing buddy, posting tweets&#8230;Find someone to talk to and talk your ideas out. It&#8217;ll help you get comfortable with sharing ideas in progress with others; also, two heads are always better than one. But&#8230;watch out who you share with. Sometimes those conversations backfire, especially if they assume you want sources, for example, and all you want to know is whether your ideas are making sense or not. Too much feedback can kill that vibe. Be clear: &#8220;I just want to know if I&#8217;m making sense.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I am working on something and I think it might be interesting to others. What do you think?&#8221;</p> 
                                            
                                            <div>
                                              <div>
                                                4) <strong>Share your written ideas with someone else.</strong> The first step to overcoming the feeling of vulnerability is actually sharing the work-in-progress with someone. Maybe it&#8217;s a writing buddy, maybe it&#8217;s a total stranger on social media. But getting feedback early helps you revise before The Final Product is out there. And yes, this can apply to blog posts too.</p> 
                                                
                                                <div>
                                                  <div>
                                                    5) <strong>Remember that finished products are almost never Finished Products.</strong> I struggled with my dissertation. You all know this. Part of how I got that huge manuscript done was that I realized a) it will never be &#8220;finished&#8221; b) there will always be something to add, something to read. I became comfortable with &#8220;good enough.&#8221; Now I cringe a little when someone asks me if they can see it, but I realize that it&#8217;s a snapshot of a point in time of my thinking and research on the topic of urban spaces and migrant communities. It&#8217;s the beginning of a bigger project. Same thing goes for blog posts. You can edit them. You can add an addendum to them. You can rewrite them. The notion that our words are set in stone is difficult to overcome (especially for academics who have come to see print as the end-all be-all of our research), but our texts are a little more malleable than we think.</p> 
                                                    
                                                    <div>
                                                      <div>
                                                        Notice how in the points above I went from little steps to bigger steps. The major point here is to realize that writing is a social act, even if we do not always make our writing available immediately. It benefits from different readers at different times. If you step away from the idea that writing is a solitary endeavor that rests upon the shoulders of one sole writer who knows everything (that shit is scary, yo), you can allow yourself to think about ways to share your writing.
