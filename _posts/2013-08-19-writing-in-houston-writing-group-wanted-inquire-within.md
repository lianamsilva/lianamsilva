Shortly after I arrived in Houston, I decided that I would give freelance writing a shot. I would finally do what I had been thinking about for years: take time to write regularly and deliberately make a career out of it. Freelance writing. Such excitement! I will finally become the person I want to be! A professional writer! Just write and shit!

Alas, I found I only had my husband and my Internet peeps to share this with. And a few family members. I realized I wanted to interact with writers, not as a fan but as a fellow writer. Working with writers is something that gives me much joy as an editor and writing specialist,  but I also wanted that same sense of community for myseIf in real life. So I looked for a writing group.

I found one, eventually. I won&#8217;t discuss the process of finding this particular writing group because I don&#8217;t want to a) give away any information that could identify them b) seem like I&#8217;m trashing them. To be honest, this isn&#8217;t a review of a writing group. The folks in the group I met seemed like genuinely nice people who are looking to share with other writers.

We just didn&#8217;t click.

Have you ever been on dates where you meet the person and things seem to be going okay (you like them, they seem to be interested in what you&#8217;re saying, there are no awkward moments of silence) but it really goes nowhere? You both walk out of the cafe/restaurant/bar/wherever, and what a coincidence, you&#8217;re both headed in the same direction in the parking lot. So you both stand there, in between each others cars and say, &#8220;It was really nice meeting you&#8221;

&#8220;Thanks for coming out.&#8221;

&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m glad we finally met!&#8221;

&#8220;Good luck with that project at work.&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, thanks, I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes. Tomorrow&#8217;s the big day. And I hope your brother gets better soon.&#8221;

&#8220;Thanks, yeah, me too.&#8221;

Awkward hug.

&#8220;Ok, talk to you soon.&#8221;

&#8220;Sure, talk to you soon.&#8221;

You both walk away. And that&#8217;s it. You realize you don&#8217;t have this person&#8217;s phone number or email address until after you pulled out of the parking lot.

The place we met was nice, and certainly conducive to writing. (I&#8217;m certainly going to return in the future and review it.) We chatted for a little bit about what we were all working on and our stories about how we got here literally and figuratively, and they all seemed to be nice. Everyone was a newbie, except toward the end (when the writing session was supposed to begin) when some of the vets of the group showed up to write. I finished revising an essay, said my goodbyes, mentioned something about attending a workshop session they were having soon, and then I walked to my car and drove away. The end.

There wasn&#8217;t anything wrong with the group, honestly. I think it was more about me and my expectations and needs. Most of the people there were working on fiction. Me, I&#8217;m working on nonfiction. Most of the people there had an idea that they wanted to develop (a story that&#8217;s part of a series, a novel, a memoir) but I was just starting. I mentioned my idea to turn my dissertation into a book for a broader audience, but really, I didn&#8217;t feel ready to talk about that with this group of people. I probably should have just said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just starting out.&#8221; Maybe the problem was that: I&#8217;m still too early in my career. I&#8217;ve only recently started pitching on a regular basis.

Finding writing groups are tough. I should know: part of my job as a writing specialist was to put them together for graduate students. Sometimes those groups clicked, sometimes they didn&#8217;t. In my case, it didn&#8217;t, and it wasn&#8217;t anybody&#8217;s fault. Writing groups are a matter of personalities matching, projects lining up, and sometimes just dumb luck.

More importantly,when looking for writing buddies/groups, we need to be aware of what we need and what the buddy/group is offering or is looking for. In my case, I needed (need) someone to talk my ideas through and to offer me guidance and, frankly, give me some sort of mentorship in terms of non-fiction. I still haven&#8217;t found that person. (My blogs are my way of working through my questions in a very public way, but that&#8217;s fodder for another day.) In the case of the group, I realized later that these were folks who were looking for feedback on their writing, and the occasional writing-together meeting. We were just looking for different things.

Would I give another Houston writing group a try? Sure. I&#8217;m one of those writers who enjoys working in the proximity to other writers, and I love talking shop when it comes to writing. But I think that I&#8217;ll need to find a mentor first so that I can attend these groups and not worry so much about genre and just focus on the community aspect.
