This week&#8217;s Friday&#8217;s post is coming in late<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">&#8211;</span>a day late, to be precise. Even though I have several rough drafts of posts in the works, I wasn&#8217;t able to polish one in time for Friday morning. The funny thing is, for this week&#8217;s end-of-week post I am coming up with something from scratch&#8230;because sometimes inspiration strikes and you have to run with it.

It didn&#8217;t start out that way though: this morning I woke up, determined to leave the house and do some work. By &#8220;work&#8221; I mean: a) dissertation stuff b) journal article stuff. [This summer I am working on my dissertation, which is a almost a full time job as it is, and I am trying to revise the first chapter of my dissertation to submit to a journal. This on top of eating, sleeping, watching Miss E, and trying to squeeze in some leisurely reading of my own.] I also wanted to get my work done early so I could spend time with my family and our guest this weekend. So I packed my bag and got out by 8:40 am. New record.

At least I thought I packed my bag&#8230;you see, when I got to Starbuck&#8217;s I saw I left my laptop&#8217;s power cord. My laptop is worthless without it. Then, I thought to myself that I could just focus on reading Lorraine Hansberry&#8217;s *Raisin in the Sun* (which I am reading for Chapter 3). However, I left my book at home. So here I was, two hours to myself, without my laptop cord and without the book I meant to read. Just my luck.

I was very upset. Actually, &#8220;very upset&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even begin to explain how I felt. I was frustrated, angry, unpleasant. But I sat down and typed up some emails I needed to send out to my writing group anyway. I was determined to stick my middle finger out at Murphy and his stupid law. (Figuratively, of course.) I couldn&#8217;t let this time go to waste.

After a while, though, I grew tired of the noise and loud chatter at Starbuck&#8217;s. This particular Starbuck&#8217;s is one of the noisiest caf√©s I&#8217;ve gone to work. I&#8217;m used to working with chatter and music&#8211;in fact, I prefer it&#8211;but this was ridiculous. So I left in search of another place to work.

    My writing nook for this morning
  </p>
</div>

I found a little bench at a statue here at the corner of Nichols Road and Pennsylvania Avenue, and sat down with the intention to work on my abstract. I was struck with the idea for this post instead. Writing in public, with no headphones on, turned out to be better for my creative juices than hunkering down at Starbuck&#8217;s and typing away at my laptop. (It&#8217;s also a lot quieter than that Starbuck&#8217;s down the street.) I probably won&#8217;t come here again&#8211;the sun is slowly creeping up on me, and there are more customers out and about&#8211;but it was nice to sit here for a while and write in peace.
