Last week I received a submission via the sidebar (and you can submit too!) about how to change voice in their writing.

*Dear Writer Whisperer,*

*Are you familiar with how a writer can change up their voice by stealing/mimicking the voice/writing styles of others? I feel like I am in a rut where I use the same sentence construction and words. I want to diversify my style and try new ways of writing. Do you think you could write a how-to blog post on this topic?*

*Sincerely,*  
*Devoted Reader*

Sidenote: I love &#8220;Dear Writer Whisperer.&#8221; Makes me feel very Dear Abby, like I should be typing this on a typewriter.

Onto the issue: voice is one of those &#8220;intangibles&#8221; in writing, one of those aspects of a text that we can pinpoint when we sense it but we have trouble explaining exactly what it is. Part of the problem is that it conflates senses: it assumes that the voice (a sonic thing) is palpable in writing (a visual thing). *Sonic metaphors for writing are a complicated thing, but I shall discuss that in a future post. *Voice is related to a particular writer&#8217;s style, and that should not be stolen&#8211;after all, it is a writer&#8217;s style, and we should develop our own if we plan to be professional writers. Our writerly voice comes through our personality in writing, the content of the piece, the audience we&#8217;re writing for, and the way we construct our sentences. However, I think what Devoted Reader is getting at is, how do we change things up a bit in our writing if we are tired of our own writing style? How do we work on our voice if we sense that our voice really doesn&#8217;t carry above the hum of all the other professional writers out there?

*See what I did there? Mix sonic metaphors? I&#8217;m killing it today&#8230;*

I often point out to writers I am working with that when they&#8217;re stumped they should look to writers/books/pieces they admire or that resonate with them. I don&#8217;t advocate for copying and pasting; instead, I ask my writers to think for a moment like readers first and writers second. Namely, I ask them to think about what makes that particular writer/book/piece stand out. Why do they like it so much? This conversation may lead to &#8220;I like how I lose myself in their prose&#8221; or &#8220;I kept on reading and didn&#8217;t stop until I was done&#8211;it was such an easy read!&#8221; or &#8220;the sentences don&#8217;t seem complicated at all even though the ideas are very complex.&#8221; With that, I know we&#8217;re onto something!

That leads me to the writerly questions. What makes you lose yourself in the reading? How are those sentences built?

*Is it word choice?

*Is it organization?

*Is it use of anecdotes?

*Is it language?

*Is it the flow of the piece?

*Is it sentence structure?

And so on.

I don&#8217;t think that you need a high level of knowledge about how grammar and syntax works to answer those questions, but they do help. I for one enjoy learning about how nouns, verbs, prepositions work. *That explains why I write this Friday Free Writing in the first place! *After you&#8217;ve answered those questions, you have some sort of template that you can use in your own writing.

Templates don&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re going to copy sentence structures straight from one article into your own writing. Instead, it means that when you&#8217;re writing and you know you&#8217;re about  to write in the same style you usually write, you can think back to what other writers have done successfully, you can take that out of your toolbox and apply it to your text.

Another thing that can also be helpful is to have someone look at your writing and help you figure out how your voice comes across. Ask them to focus not on mistakes or on the content but to zone in on what stands out about your writing. Point out to them that you&#8217;re looking for adjectives that describe your writing. ([This guest post][1] by Julie Wildhaber on [Grammar Girl&#8217;s site ][2]about voice in writing has plenty of tips to help you find your voice.)

For example, and this one isn&#8217;t necessarily a writing example but it still works, [Rachel Maddow][3] from MSNBC&#8217;s *[Rachel Maddow Show][4] *is one of the people whose style and voice I admire. I used to listen to podcasts of Maddow&#8217;s show when I&#8217;d drive to work in the morning. One of the things I loved about Maddow is that she usually opens up the show with an anecdote, moves from the anecdote to some historical/political/cultural event in another time and place, and makes connections that I *never* would have considered. In that way, she broke down political news in a way that I, someone who knows less of politics than your average college graduate, could understand. As a result, I feel I pay attention more to politics; she makes politics accessible to me without dumbing it down (that last part is especially important). I would love to replicate those moves in my own writing: writing in a smart way about cultural topics but still making them accessible to a broad audience. I&#8217;d also love to hang out with Maddow, but that&#8217;s because she seems like one of the coolest smart people around. That&#8217;s just me.

So one thing I would ask Devoted Reader (and other readers) is to consider what stands out about the writers they enjoy to read and what makes them so enjoyable. Resist the urge to write in the same way you&#8217;re used to and try someone else&#8217;s approach for once. See how that fits.

Any other advice for Devoted Reader?

*Bonus track*:

As I drove to the airport to pick up my mom last Saturday I heard [this *All Things Considered* interview with Irene Diaz][5]. I hope you enjoy her music like I did.
