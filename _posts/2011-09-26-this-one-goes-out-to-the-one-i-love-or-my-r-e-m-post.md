**The title is a line from R.E.M.&#8217;s &#8220;The One I Love,&#8221; from their album *Document.

In case you missed it, [R.E.M. announced this week that they were breaking up][1]. Established in 1981, R.E.M. has been performing for 30 years. In fact, R.E.M. is only a few months&#8217; older than I am.

I&#8217;ve been an R.E.M. fan since I was in 7th grade. I don&#8217;t remember my reaction when I first heard &#8220;Losing My Religion,&#8221; but I know that &#8220;Losing My Religion&#8221; was the first song I&#8217;d ever heard from R.E.M. I liked their music so much that I bought *Out of Time* on tape, one of my first album purchases as a young teenager. My musical tastes might have changed a lot over the years (for one, I actually like rap now, something I never would&#8217;ve considered in high school), but there was always one constant: R.E.M.

It may sound sappy, but I felt an era of my life had come to an end. To be honest, I am aware that bands come and go and that some bands never last as long as R.E.M. did, but I never could imagine that R.E.M. would ever break up. I mean, c&#8217;mon, the Rolling Stones are still touring, right? Ahem&#8230;I never thought of my life without R.E.M., not that I needed to think about these things. I will always have their albums to listen to over and over again (and thanks to the Internet and to programs like Spotify I can discover &#8220;new music&#8221; in the shape of bootlegs from different gigs over the years), but it still stings a little. R.E.M. has been a major part of my adult life.

For one, I credit them, in an indirect way, my career as a cultural critic. R.E.M. made me *think*. I listened to the songs from *Out of Time* over and over. I transcribed the songs trying to figure out what Michael Stipe was saying. And once I had painstakingly figured out what their songs said, I wanted to know what they were about. The songs had stories, and I wanted to know what those stories were. For a young teenager living in Puerto Rico, and with no internet access until college, it wasn&#8217;t as easy as it is today: just Google &#8220;R.E.M. songs+meanings&#8221; and see what pops up. But in the 90s I bought magazine after magazine, trying to piece together the context, the background, the history of the song.

I also learned how to be a music fan through R.E.M. I started reading *Rolling Stone* and *Spin* magazine regularly. I also purchased *Guitar World on* ocassional, when Peter Buck or Mike Mills were featured. I devoured every piece of information I could get my hands on. I wanted to hear what they heard, and I wanted to read what they read. Through R.E.M. I found out about Patti Smith, about The Beats, about B-52s, about The Byrds, about Tori Amos. Just the other day I was comparing versions of The Velvet Underground&#8217;s &#8220;Femme Fatale&#8221; with a friend of mine. I told her I knew the song through R.E.M. because they covered it for *Dead Letter Office. *Oh, and I became the kind of fan who buys the obscure albums no one listens to because that&#8217;s what real fans do.

But this is not an homage to R.E.M. or a long post mourning their break-up. I considered doing both, but in the end I didn&#8217;t think my post would be any different from any other super fan&#8217;s blog post. Instead, I decided to do one of my &#8220;Five Songs&#8221; series posts about five R.E.M. songs that I love. If you like&#8211;or love&#8211;R.E.M., post your faves in the comments.

So here we go, five R.E.M. songs I love&#8211;in no particular order because I can&#8217;t pick my favorite R.E.M. song of all time. Please. You should know me better than that.)

1) &#8220;Leave,&#8221; from *New Adventures in Hi-Fi*

*New Adventures in Hi-Fi* is one of my favorite R.E.M. albums. It&#8217;s underrated, as demonstrated by the little airplay it gets in R.E.M. retrospectives. However, it wasn&#8217;t my favorite off the bat. It took a few listens for me to get into it. (I had a similar experience with *Up*, even though that album isn&#8217;t at the level of *Hi-Fi.*) When I decided to make this list, I knew I&#8217;d pick a song from *Hi-Fi*, but I was torn about which one to choose because they&#8217;re all so good! Ultimately, I chose this one because it has one of my favorite R.E.M. lines of all time: &#8220;I suffer dreams of a world gone mad/ I like it like that and I know it.&#8221;

2) &#8220;Leaving New York,&#8221; from *Around the Sun*

This one was easy. It&#8217;s a song about New York, so why wouldn&#8217;t it be on my list? But that&#8217;s not the only reason why I chose it. This song always gets me a little choked up. It reminds me of when my boyfriend left to Kansas City. I was staying behind in New York because I had to work. I made him a mix CD, like I sometimes do, to entertain him on the 18-hour-drive to the Midwest. As a bonus track, I added this song and left it out of the track listing. To this day, when I hear this song I think of his car pulling out of our driveway and onto our street. I wouldn&#8217;t see him again until about six months later.

Also, &#8220;You find it in your heart, it&#8217;s pulling me apart&#8221; has to be one of the saddest lines in R.E.M.&#8217;s repertoire.

3) &#8220;These Days&#8221; from *Life&#8217;s Rich Pageant*

An old hit that I re-discovered when *R.E.M. Live at the Olympia *came out last year. I remember playing this song on tape, rewinding it and playing it again. Thing is, this was the second song on Side A, so I had to listen to &#8220;Begin The Begin&#8221; again and again to listen to &#8220;These Days.&#8221; As a result I also know &#8220;Begin the Begin&#8221; by heart. Rock on.

4) &#8220;Living Well Is the Best Revenge&#8221; from *Accelerate*

This song is just awesome, all around. One of my favorites from their 2008 album, which marked a return to a harder rock and roll sound. Sidenote: as I was looking for a video of this song, I came across this one from their *Austin City Limits *performance. I&#8217;d forgotten about that one!

<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span> 

5) &#8220;Country Feedback&#8221; from *Out of Time*

I know I said it&#8217;s hard for me to come up with a Top Five list of favorite R.E.M. songs in order, but this one is definitely Top Three. I remember being a teenager and falling in love with this song. Years later, this song still makes me stop whatever I am doing and listen closely. It disarms me.

&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy what you could&#8217;ve had.&#8221;

Bonus track:

I couldn&#8217;t end on such a heavy note, so here&#8217;s &#8220;Stand&#8221; from 1989&#8242;s *Green. *I chose this one because it reminds me of my brother and I singing along to it and never knowing the direction that comes next in the song. He and I went to my first and only R.E.M. concert together in New York City.
