So the writing. Lately it&#8217;s been coming out, streaming out. Right now my writing seems to have no direction, but it just keeps on coming out. I have ideas, and they seem to be all over the place, and I just want to share them with the world. So sometimes I go and write in different places because a different place will jolt my brain into working again. I find different places to sit and write and follow the trail of thought that shows up from time to time.

I start out my day writing. I know, it sounds pretty idealistic (&#8220;The Writer Who Can&#8217;t Wait to Write&#8221;) but the truth is, if I don&#8217;t get the gears in my head moving early, the morning just unfurls and I lose touch with my prime creative real estate: morning time for free writing. That happens at home. I am lucky that I have an office at the opposite end of our apartment, away from our master bedroom and my toddler&#8217;s room: it forces me to leave my bed. I roll out around 6:30, and I write (sometimes gibberish, sometimes thoughtful things) until around 7:30. The muscle memory&#8211;not the thrill of the empty page&#8211;is what gets me from the bed, down the hall, across the living room, into the office, and in my chair at my desk.

Unless I&#8217;m traveling, I wouldn&#8217;t do my freewriting anywhere other than at that desk. But when I&#8217;m writing during the day, I change locations (especially because as a freelancer I work from home a lot). Oftentimes I end up at cafes.

Being new in Houston, I look for the spots I can call my own, and that goes for cafes where I can get work done. But I also enjoy exploring the city. I oftentimes get in my car and try new side streets, go to a supermarket across town just to see what&#8217;s going on, or visit a new restaurant in a side of town I&#8217;m not familiar with. I&#8217;m still learning the neighborhoods around town. (For example, I tell people I live in Gulfton because Wikipedia told me so, but no one who lives in Houston seems to know what that means. If I say south of The Galleria, they get a better idea.)

So recently I went to a cafe that someone on Twitter recommended a while back: [Blacksmith][1]. Why did I go here? No reason, other than someone mentioned it to me, and I was under a deadline (submit my Junot Diaz article) and I couldn&#8217;t think of anywhere else to go work. But once I made it here, I realized I could love this place.

**What do I like about this place?** Unpretentious. Low-key. Short-but-solid menu. The location is a little out of my way, but I&#8217;ll go out of my way for a nice cafe. Typical coffee shop noise. Music isn&#8217;t too loud; you can tune in or tune out. Wifi is free. Coffee is tasty&#8211;and affordable, if you go with the bottomless cup of their daily roast.

**What&#8217;s the lay of the land?** Blacksmith has a handful of tables, and also has tables outside. Plenty of counter space. Don&#8217;t be afraid to sit up close to the baristas; they&#8217;re good folks. Outlets are along the counter by the front window. You may need to bring your charger with you, if you plan to work for long periods of time here.

**Who will you see here?** Freelancers, writers, people studying, folks working on their laptops. Folks who come and go looking for coffee and chit chat.

**What did I eat/drink?** Coffee, always. When I first came here, I went with a bacon, gouda, green tomato sandwich that was pretty tasty but didn&#8217;t hit the spot. I was looking for breakfast food, and that&#8217;s not precisely breakfast. However, the bottomless coffee, water jug, and later a biscuit with marmalade and creme fraiche held me throughout the day. Second time I came here, I went with the biscuit and creme fraiche because, damnit, it&#8217;s tasty. And biscuits are their specialty.

**What did I write here?** I finished revising an academic essay, my essay on Junot Diaz.

**What could you write here?** A draft of your first novel. If the soundtrack makes it into the book, it&#8217;ll probably be set in the 80s to 90s.

**What did I not like about this place?** The chairs by the counter. I had to get used to sitting on the backless bar stools.

**One last thing:** Once you&#8217;re done working, you can treat yourself to a book or a writing instrument at Half Price Books across the street.

PS: &#8220;Writing Away from Home&#8221; is part of what is my new Monday offering: writing (in) Houston, which will include anything related to writing in the city of Houston. Because I&#8217;m a writer and because I&#8217;m discovering my new city, I wanted to share with you the writerly things I find out about H-town.
