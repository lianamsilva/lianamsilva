In the past few weeks I have written, revised, rewritten, rethought this post. I&#8217;ve debated whether to post it or delete it, but I always end up clicking the &#8220;Save Draft&#8221; button and promise myself I&#8217;ll come back later. However, I realized this past weekend that perhaps the problem is that I don&#8217;t know what I am trying to say with this post&#8230;or maybe I&#8217;m trying to find answers when all I have are questions. Maybe I should just post and see what comes of the post; as [Kathleen Fitzpatrick says on her blog][1]: &#8220;my task for the coming weeks is to work on just making the words fit, on just putting them out there, unashamed that they are nothing more than what they are.&#8221;

Now that I am finally The Doctor&#8211;regalia, hooding, and everything&#8211;I feel like I can finally start thinking about The Future. Not as in &#8220;the rest of my life&#8221; but in terms of my career. The last year I would think about employment from time to time, but I usually let those thoughts drift away; after all, I had a dissertation to finish and a clock that was ticking away. I focused on the concrete goal I had in front of me (defend my dissertation in the spring semester) instead of the abstract, scary thing that was my career post-PhD.

Lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about career versus employment. I spent the last eight years training to be a fellow humanities scholar in the academy. That is not only what I was trained to do (and we can debate whether that is a good or a bad thing), but what I wanted to do. I wanted to become a scholar, an intellectual. I went into graduate school to become a professor but I also went to graduate school because I had a passion for learning and for thinking. A humanities degree is meant to prepare graduates to find their place as scholars in their fields of research.

Indeed, the past year I have felt more like a scholar than a student. (I don&#8217;t mean that students are not scholars, but instead that, in my case, I used to think of myself as a student and not as a scholar. In the past year I moved away from that mentality, while not losing sight of the fact that I had to finish my PhD.) So, even though I am not currently employed in something directly related to my research, I still feel emotionally invested in  my research. My identity as a scholar is connected to my research. It also helps that, later on in the writing process, I rediscovered my personal connection to my dissertation&#8217;s topic, and so now I feel like it would be a disservice to let it go. As I work part-time, now I have a little extra time to devote to reading articles, doing research, working on revisions. However, I am still part-time, and I need full-time employment; eventually, that time I have now to work on my own research will be diminished.

In the meantime, I have been thinking about what it means to be an unaffiliated researcher.<span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;">It seems like this may be my fate, at least for the next few months.</span> Because I obtained a graduate degree in the humanities, I am very familiar with what employment and careers within the academy look like. I also currently work at a doctoral-granting institution. But what does it look like to do research and work on subjects you love without the sponsorship of a college department? *Am I stretching myself too thin, between my work and my research, which I do on my own down time?* Maybe these questions arise because I am moving from Career to Job. (Or am I? I&#8217;m still working in higher education, and my current position requires me to use my research skills and think critically about the information I come across.) I&#8217;ve been trained to think in terms of careers all throughout graduate school, and as a graduate student all of my research endeavors felt connected to one career: humanities scholar. Maybe I need to do better at weaving my research into my work, so that it all comes together again.

At the end of the day, I know three things: I want to continue doing research. I have new directions I want to take my work in. I may be coy or even unsure sometimes about my teaching abilities, but I am certain my research skills are strong. Research is something I enjoy doing. I also want to continue to write. Writing makes me happy; specifically, being able to balance academic writing with non-dissertation-related writing helped me regain my mental sanity over the past year. Whatever comes next, I want writing to become a central part of my future. I also want to return to teach&#8230;in some capacity. I enjoy teaching. Like I mentioned [in my post for U Venus in May 2011][2], I didn&#8217;t leave teaching because I didn&#8217;t like it. Now that I&#8217;ve been away from the classroom for a year I&#8217;m thinking of how to make it back into teaching.

Such is my life post-dissertation&#8230;
