My husband recently made it to his dream job, <a href=" http://www.lianamsilvaford.com/aural-memories-or-my-husbands-play-by-play-voice/" target="_blank">becoming a play by play radio broadcaster for a major league baseball team</a>. He&#8217;s quite the inspiration: he applied for job after job after job for years. As long as I&#8217;ve known him (6 years and counting!) he&#8217;s applied for baseball gigs all over the country. (Over the years, we&#8217;ve had more than one conversation about the locations of certain jobs.) The word &#8220;quit&#8221; does not exist in his vocabulary.

I was reminded of his story of rejection when I tweeted this weekend about my rejection letters from when I applied for dissertation fellowships.

  <p>
    Just remembered: the year I applied for external dissertation fellowships, I had a folder of all the rejections I got. I wonder where it is.

My husband replied,

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

He had to go ahead and top me, didn&#8217;t he?

Anyway, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about rejection lately as I continue to figure out the freelance writing business. (I&#8217;m sure some of you just rolled your eyes at me because you can tell by what I just said that I know nothing about freelance writing. You&#8217;re probably right.) I&#8217;ve sent some pitches, I&#8217;ve even sent some completed essays/blog posts, and I&#8217;ve come up with nothing. I know the fact that I have not received a response other than &#8220;Thank you; I&#8217;ll get back to you&#8221; isn&#8217;t personal. I also think my ideas are pretty good, so it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m lacking ideas. But I find myself wondering about what&#8217;s not happening.

I know I&#8217;ll keep on writing even if no one publishes my writing for years. <a href="http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Junot-Diaz-Talks-About-What-Made-Him-Become-a-Writer" target="_blank">If Junot Diaz can handle it</a>, I can too. So I&#8217;m not going to stop writing because no one has shown interest in my pitches. (Also, to be fair, I&#8217;ve been pitching an idea here or an essay there since April this year, so it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve been on the freelance market for years&#8230;not yet.) I&#8217;m fairly certain that I will continue to get up early and write as the years go by.

However, I do wonder. Part of it is, freelance writing is new to me. <a href="http://www.lianamsilvaford.com/write-she-said/" target="_blank">I took a course earlier this year</a> on selling op-eds and personal essays, and I got the basics of how to pitch and what to send. But there&#8217;s still something that feels like I&#8217;ve done something wrong.

It brings me back to that year I applied for approximately 10 dissertation fellowships. I was about to run out of graduate school funding, and all I could think of what &#8220;I need a dissertation fellowship to finish.&#8221; Never mind that dissertation fellowships are extremely competitive and I had not written my dissertation proposal yet. Never mind that I could have looked for a job instead of apply for fellowships. My mentor and my advisor encouraged me to just write, apply, and keep working on the dissertation. And that I did.

In the Spring I received rejection letter after rejection letter. Granted, I only applied for a handful of fellowships, but every letter hit hard.

That year, I had one interview and no fellowship offers. The one interview burned the most: I was flown out for the day, treated to a nice seafood lunch (after all, this was New England), given a tour of the school grounds, and hit it off with the two directors of the institute. I even sent them a handwritten thank you card. I never heard from them again. *Sidebar: they were going to reimburse me for my trip expenses, and I actually had to contact their office months later to ask them what was going on. Yeah.* Have you ever been on a great date with someone, only to have them ignore you and never call you again? This feels the same way.

That experience broke my heart. I felt like it was a clear sign that all this talent and knowledge I had was not good enough for academia. I wondered what I had done wrong, and what I could have done better. All I could think about was, &#8220;I have to do better.&#8221; Years later, I decided against pursuing a tenure-track job because I realized that the odds were stacked against me&#8230;and that it was of no fault of my own.

I bring this up because I do feel puzzled when I don&#8217;t get a response to a pitch or an essay that I&#8217;ve emailed an editor. But, contrary to when I was in graduate school, I can feel it in my gut that my writing is worth it. I know I can improve (we writers can always improve) but I think my ideas, my words have potential. So, even though the radio silence stings, I know that I&#8217;ll keep on writing. There&#8217;s no other way I&#8217;d have it.

*Dear readers, how have you handled rejection in the past? What do you do in order to move on? Leave a comment below or send me a tweet: <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica" target="_blank">@literarychica</a>*
