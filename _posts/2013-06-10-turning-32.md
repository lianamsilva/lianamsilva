This is not a birthday post. Well, maybe it is because it emerges from the fact that when I wrote it it was my birthday and I was thinking about these things. Also, I had no Internet, so I just typed this on my iPad and let it sit there until I could come back to it.

*So let&#8217;s close our eyes and pretend it&#8217;s June 5 again&#8230;*

Somehow, thinking about turning 32 today made me think about John Mayer&#8217;s song &#8220;83,&#8221; from his 2001 album *[Room for Squares][1].* If you&#8217;ve never heard, it&#8217;s a song where John Mayer waxes nostalgic about being 6 in 1983 and the simplicity of things as they used to be. Maybe it was the coincidence of 3&#8242;s (my mind often finds patterns in things that a lot of people don&#8217;t really care about) but I kept on humming the song in my head until I decided to just sit down and type this post.

I&#8217;m not about to wax nostalgic about wanting to be younger, or wanting to relive an earlier period in my life. On the contrary, I&#8217;m feeling pretty good about my 30s. I am not about to romanticize what my life used to be in my 20s; it was lots of fun, but I also spent a lot of time figuring out who the heck I was. As far as I&#8217;m concerned I&#8217;m still working on that. And maybe we never really stop figuring that out. (Is that what being in your 30s is all about?)

As for me, this is where I am today:

**At 32 I live in Houston, Texas.** Years ago, I would have never imagined myself living in the state of Texas. I&#8217;m a liberal who had some liberal stereotypes (heck, I had them about Kansas too, and I made it through three years of KC, unscathed), and frankly, I dreamed of moving to NYC when I was done with school. But things change, and my family situation brought me to Texas. Right now, we&#8217;re loving Houston. It&#8217;s not New York, but I only want one New York in my life.

**By 32 I have lived in three different U.S. states, and one U.S. colony.** I&#8217;ve also done plenty of traveling, thanks to my academic career: Hawaii, London, Calgary, Vienna, Mexico&#8230;and I hope we don&#8217;t stop.

**I&#8217;ve worked at three different schools**, and two of them were research universities. I&#8217;ve created and taught college-level courses, although only one of them is a literature course I&#8217;ve created. Teaching that course changed me, and I wish I could teach literature again. But I also had the chance to work in student support, and I enjoyed working with my writers day in and day out.

**I have realized that dreams can change.** People change, feelings change, desires and needs change. Our dreams can change, too. My dream of becoming a tenure-track professor has morphed into something else entirely. That doesn&#8217;t mean that change is easy. But admitting to myself that I&#8217;ve changed is a big step, and I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m on the other side.

**I have realized that some dreams will never change.** Just recently I moved to Houston, leaving behind one job I enjoyed tremendously and leaping into the void of uncertainty. But even though unemployment scares the crap out of me, I am also choosing to see it as an opportunity and try my hand at something I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a while. (I&#8217;m not saying everyone who is unemployed should do this. I&#8217;m just saying that this is the approach I took. Unemployment is NOT a laughing matter. We were also fortunate to have the financial means so that I could try something that might not be profitable at first.) So I&#8217;m taking the plunge and resolved to dedicate more time to writing. Writing is something that has always meant a lot to me, and I was fortunate enough to spend the past two years working with graduate student writers. Now I have the chance to dedicate myself to that, to take it seriously and go from teenage fantasy to reality.

**I have a child**. Unlike some people, who dream their whole lives about being parents, I focused more on my career. Now, almost four years since I found out I was expecting, I have the brightest, cutest kid. (I&#8217;m biased, so don&#8217;t take it personal.) She is a little adult in a toddler&#8217;s body, and she marvels me.

**At 32, I feel like I can do so many things**, and it doesn&#8217;t mean I have to do all of them, or that I can&#8217;t do one if I do the other. I feel a lot more possibility in my 30s than I did in my 20s. (Maybe it&#8217;s the medication? Who knows.) But I do know that I&#8217;ve chilled out a lot when it comes to the day-to-day craziness and uncertainty that can happen at any given moment.

**Me at 32 is embracing a new career path**, and it scares me but it&#8217;s also exciting. Jumping onto the freelance wagon is crazy. But jumping is also freeing. I always liked being able to create my own schedule, and lately I worried a lot about not having time to explore my own writing and research. And if it doesn&#8217;t work out? I can always try something else. Four years ago I would not have dared consider the possibility of trying something else. I&#8217;m going with what makes me happy right now.

As I wrote this post, I had John Mayer&#8217;s &#8220;83&#8243; on repeat, if you can believe that. One line that stands out to me as I type is this:

> &#8220;Most of my memories have escaped me, or confused themselves with dreams.
> 
> If heaven&#8217;s all we want it to be, send your prayers to me care of 1983.&#8221;

If you&#8217;re the praying kind, just send your prayers to me care of 32. Things are looking pretty good.
