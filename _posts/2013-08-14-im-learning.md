Some days I&#8217;m on Twitter and I just start tweeting random streams of thought that flow into my head. *Isn&#8217;t that the point of Twitter? *Maybe. I guess. Not really. I mean, sure, I could tweet about bacon (and I have) or shout at the MS Word program on my laptop ([like I did this morning][1]) but sometimes I have thoughts about my work or my writing and they just come out.

Here&#8217;s the rant, in tweet form:

    Post-dissertation, I have found new things I want to learn about and of course I want to immerse myself completely in learning those things.

    The trick is, embracing the fact that I don&#8217;t need to learn everything about that one topic/object/idea. It&#8217;s okay to learn bit by bit. — Liana Silva Ford (@literarychica) <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica/statuses/366940290830966785">August 12, 2013</a>

    Like, learning about digital humanities, for example. I feel the pressure (from outside? inside?) to learn everything about it, keep up. — Liana Silva Ford (@literarychica) <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica/statuses/366940459324538880">August 12, 2013</a>

    I do have a certain amount of privilege though; I&#8217;ll admit: I am not interested in TT jobs, and I care about DH for my own work, on my own.

    I can afford that. So, in other words, my approach isn&#8217;t necessarily an approach that works for everyone. — Liana Silva Ford (@literarychica) <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica/statuses/366940960124440577">August 12, 2013</a>

*That last one is just me showing off.*

I&#8217;ve been thinking about learning. And part of what I&#8217;m blogging about lately is how I am learning about myself as I write, and about myself as a (freelance) writer. For one, I&#8217;ve been thinking about what my &#8220;niche&#8221; is, what kind of writer I am.

Academic?

Intellectual?

Funny?

Critical?

Non-fiction?

Fiction?

Tweeter Extraordinaire?

*That last one is just me making stuff up.*

Yes, as I get back into writing (and I am trying to write regularly, even when not under deadline) I am trying to figure out what kind of writing suits me best. I’m leaning toward non-fiction because I like reading it and because I feel it&#8217;s a good fit for me, at this point in my (early? mid?) career. But I also wonder: what are my skills? What are my strong points? What am I good at? Rebecca Schuman’s recent blog post taking down the phrase <a href="http://pankisseskafka.com/2013/07/27/please-stop-saying-not-everyone-is-suited-for-academia/" target="_blank">“not suited for academia”</a> made me think, is there something I am better suited for than academic writing?

I find myself reaching out to new things, learning new ideas, asking new questions. I am allowing myself to learn things, sure, but I also feel the pressure to pick a side, to learn everything, become an expert if you will. Is it because I never had that adolescent phase of career soul-searching? I was so determined to become a professor, that I didn’t consider other options. And exhaustively learning about a topic is something you get good at after ten years of college. You have to deprogram yourself from doing that, I think.

The other thing is, I’m back in the classroom in a week and a half. Yup, I return as an adjunct instructor for an intro to scientific writing class for graduate students at a university in Houston. And I’m nervous. In a way, teaching writing is something I have been learning about for the past few years, even after I left the classroom. I am not the same person who left the classroom in 2011. Who is this person who’s going back to teach? What tools is she bringing in her toolkit? I&#8217;ve been daydreaming for so long about what I would do If I Could Teach Another Writing Class, and now I get that chance. What will it look like? *And will I remember how to format a syllabus?*

There&#8217;s a lot of learning and reflecting going on. I&#8217;m writing, but I&#8217;m also trying to listen to myself. It&#8217;s like trying to put my own ear to my chest. Virtually impossible. I&#8217;m trying to make sense of the rumblings and piece together that sonic puzzle. After years of anxiously trying to reach the (academic) finish line, I&#8217;m trying to take my time.

Eventually, I&#8217;ll find my writerly voice outside of academia. In the meantime, you can come along for the ride.
