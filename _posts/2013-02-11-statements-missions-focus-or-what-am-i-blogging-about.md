Recently, [Pat Thompson][1] (one of my favorite bloggers out there in the field of academic writing&#8211;she&#8217;s one of the few bloggers that I read religiously) posted [about her blogging identity][2] and how that particular blog responds to one aspect of her professional persona, which prompted me to think about my own blogging identity. Around the same time [Fiona Barnett][3], director of [HASTAC][4], asked [readers for suggestions on personal websites][5], something I have been considering, but what made me stop and think was the fact that some chose to house their blog on their website and others did not. I understand the reasons, and oftentimes those whose blog was on their personal website was because the blog was related to their professional persona. Deanna Mascle, in part as a response to Pat Thompson&#8217;s post, mentioned that [she tries to limit her blog to topics related to her professional identity][6], and that sometimes she chose to post unrelated topics elsewhere.

All this talk about where blogs fit in one&#8217;s online identity has me squirming a bit over here. For one, I did not conceive of this blog as a professional blog because it was supposed to be a creative outlet for my writing, a place where I could share my writing&#8211;and by extension, my thoughts&#8211;with others. I thought long and hard about the subheading to my blog, and settled on &#8220;From academia to writing to motherhood and all stops in between&#8221; because it seems general enough but also specific. Those topics were topics I felt were most common in my first year. Now that I am much more visible online and that I finally came out and used my full name in WordPress, I know that others will be able to find my blog just by my name; so, I think it&#8217;s time to articulate (if anything, to myself) what this blog is about.

Reading [&#8220;How to Blog: My Rules&#8221;][7] (a post that is much more honest and real than any other blog post about how to blog) forced me to think about my own blog&#8217;s &#8220;mission statement.&#8221; After reading[ Dinner: A Love Story][8]&#8216;s [About page][9], I wondered, what would mine look like? The first thing that came to mind is that my blog is about writing, writing while being a mother, an (alternative) academic, a freshly-minted PhD.

So my task this semester will be to update [my blog&#8217;s About page][10] and to keep in mind that these things can change. And that it&#8217;s okay.

*Dear readers: do you have suggestions for my About page? What do you come to read when you&#8217;re here?*
