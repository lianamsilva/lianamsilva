While I was driving the other day to work, I was listening to The Thesis Whisperer&#8217;s and Lit Review HQ&#8217;s PhDChat podcast on how to write a literature review from start to finish. As I was listening, I realized something. The realization came so fast that I pressed the Home button on my iPhone, called Siri forth and told her to make a note for me:

<div id="attachment_717" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px">
  <a href="http://www.lianamsilvaford.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/note-to-self.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-717" title="note to self" alt="" src="http://www.lianamsilvaford.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/note-to-self.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="166" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Note to self
  </p>
</div>

I had forgotten about that note until recently, when I was getting ready to walk away from my laptop after doing some early morning writing. I am still not sure what about my writing is &#8220;safe,&#8221; but it feels like I have fallen into familiar territory and familiar routines.

Months ago I was worried about not having a writing routine anymore. I got into the habit of writing regularly when I was dissertating, but  once I finished I had to join the land of the living again. My intense work routine had to undergo some changes. Lately, though, I&#8217;ve gotten back into the habit of waking up a tad earlier than usual and doing some writing, whether it means working on a letter, typing up some ideas for my research, or editing a blog post.

That part of me feels at ease now, but I wonder if I am pushing my writing. Am I growing as a writer? Am I working to my full potential? Am I stuck in the same genres? Should I stop writing and do some reading, get ideas? What would taking risks in my writing look like? *Or maybe, what does it sound like? *Is it a matter of form? Of content? Of habit? Of place? Of space? Of sounds?

This month I signed up for #AcWriMo (Academic Writing Month) in order to get back into the habit of writing but also to push myself to start a new writing project. Maybe it&#8217;s wording; maybe what I need are challenges, not risks.

Dear readers and writers: what does taking risks in writing look like?
