*As in John Lennon&#8217;s &#8220;(Just Like) Starting Over&#8221;*

<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span>

  <p>
    Yesterday, I read <a href="http://thesiswhisperer.com/">The Thesis Whisperer</a>&#8216;s latest blog post titled <a href="http://thesiswhisperer.com/2013/05/07/surviving-the-reading-marathon-2/">&#8220;Surviving the Reading Marathon&#8221;</a>; the post covers tips on how to handle academic reading in graduate school. As I read it, I realized that these were tips that would have been incredibly helpful when I was in graduate school, and that I must&#8217;ve spent valuable time reading articles and books that, really, weren&#8217;t relevant to my research (or if they were, it was only tangentially). A lot of what I learned about academic writing I received from a) my mentor and my advisor, people who took the time to discuss writing with me b) texts I read and enjoyed or hated or filled me with indifference c) talking with other writers d) reading about writing&#8211;and this one is fairly new, since Twitter and Facebook put me in touch with a lot of resources that I otherwise had no clue existed. However, whatever wasn&#8217;t covered through those channels was a lost cause.

    Like the reading thing, for example. My mentor mentioned, while I wrote with a concrete and <i>tight</i> dissertation deadline, that I should be strategic with my reading. It blew my mind, but I kept cool in front of her. &#8220;Oh, word? Ok, I&#8217;ll make a note of that.&#8221; Deep down, however, I felt like I was sort of kind of cheating. Am I not supposed to read <i>every single thing </i> written on my topic? Well, yeah. Or no. Or something.</p>

      For better or for worse, the writing habits we learn in college follow us, and they are hard to break. When it comes to graduate students these habits can be deeply ingrained because graduate school (for many disciplines) trains people to be scholars. Research is part of that scholarly identity, and writing is how we share our ideas with others. <b>You are how you write</b>. And that spills over to your career, if your career involves or requires writing regularly.</p>

        So The Thesis Whisperer&#8217;s post came just in time. I have been thinking about my writing and my research habits for a while now. I feel more stable in my work habits than I did early in the fall, even with the way the impending move has rocked my writing routine. However, even though I have ideas for Future Writing Projects (and I am currently trying to get one of them off the ground), I hesitate to step into research again. I realized recently that I am avoiding researching for the academic article I have on my docket right now because I am afraid of all of the information I&#8217;ll have to comb through and I feel I don&#8217;t have enough time. Also, the writing: blog posts come a lot easier to me now (so far in the past five days I&#8217;ve written two and this one is number three, so that&#8217;s working), even when they&#8217;re a little more academic in tone (like my last post for <i><a href="http://soundstudiesblog.com/">Sounding Out!</a></i> on <a href="http://soundstudiesblog.com/2013/01/21/jean-graes-sonic-claims-on-the-city/">Jean Grae</a>), but I feel I&#8217;m out of academic writing practice. I am not sure about how to go about my academic writing anymore&#8230;and I have never written for a traditional academic journal before. I&#8217;m excellent at breaking the genres down for others, but it&#8217;s been hard to apply it to myself so far.</p>

          So I feel like I&#8217;m starting over, in terms of academic writing.  I plan to put into practice some of Thesis Whisperer&#8217;s suggestions as to how to tackle the reading. I&#8217;m also making my way through Wendy Belcher&#8217;s well-recommended book, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Your-Journal-Twelve-Weeks/dp/141295701X">Writing Your Journal Article in 12 Weeks</a></i> with a friend, in the hopes of easing back into the kind of writing I was used to doing as a graduate student. This is a brand new topic, so it&#8217;s not like I have a rough draft to work from. That&#8217;s the challenge too. I&#8217;ve forgotten what it feels like to start from scratch.</p>

            But one thing I wonder, as I type this post: am I trying to hard to write in a different style? Should I just bring my writing style (better represented in my blogging) to the article? Am I just trying to fit my square peg into a round hole?</p>
