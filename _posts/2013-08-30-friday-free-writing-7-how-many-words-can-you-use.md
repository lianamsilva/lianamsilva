This week&#8217;s question comes from one of my followers on Twitter. Word counts: what&#8217;s up with that?

Word counts. Word counts are tricky because, on the one hand, like AnnGagne points out, we should stress quality over quantity. As we should. I think lots of our problems in writing stem from using too many words to say something that can be said in only a handful. (*I&#8217;m looking at you, academic writing.*) The companion to the word count? The page limit&#8211;the one students are most familiar with. But they both boil down to the same thing: putting a limit on our written ideas.

When I started teaching first-year writing courses, I was strict with page limits because if I didn&#8217;t tell students to write a minimum of three pages, they&#8217;d probably hand in one page. But my philosophy behind it was, in the real world you will have to stick to word counts/page limits. Applications. Statements. Online Forms. Op-Eds. Articles.

Word counts seem like a formality, something that creative types shouldn&#8217;t need. Ugh, word counts? Constrain my thoughts? Eek. But word counts (or character counts, or page limits) help us edit our thoughts. Some folks would write volumes if left unconstrained&#8230;or unedited. Word counts are practical.

What happens when we don&#8217;t reach the word count though? What&#8217;s there to edit? I faced this personally this summer when working on my academic article on Junot Diaz. The minimum was 6000 words. I made it to a little less than 5000 in the first draft. And there&#8217;s the caveat: first draft. The first draft was my attempt to get all of my thoughts down. The second draft was where I was going to revise. Although I had hoped to hit my minimum word count on my first try, hey! a full draft is a full draft.

Here are some (extremely personal) tips for hitting that word count when you&#8217;re just not there yet:

1. **Reverse outline.** RO is one of my favorite revision strategies. It helps me see what the skeleton of my essay is, and whether I made all the major points I wanted to make. It also helps me see if I left any paragraphs half way or if I need to add transition sentences. With reverse organization, you should go paragraph by paragraph and write down what is the main idea of that paragraph. You should also make a note of what is the role of that paragraph: is this an introduction? is this you presenting caveats? is this evidence? And so on.

*UNC&#8217;s Writing Center explains more about reverse outlining [here][1].*

2. **Ask yourself questions.** When you finish a full draft, the temptation is to think you&#8217;ve said all you need to say. But try to take a day away from the draft and come back with a critical eye. Read through the doc and write down things you wonder about while reading: what does this mean? can you explain this example? why are you bringing this up? how does this happen? Be your own critic. Do this for one revision session, and work on your answers the next time around.

3. **Dissect those paragraphs.** While working with graduate student writers, I realized that the basics of writing are often forgotten when we dive into more complex ideas. Or sometimes we just think we know what a paragraph is and we move on. We&#8217;re grown folks! But stop and think at each paragraph: do I have a topic sentence? Do I explain my main idea? Do I have an example to back this up? Do I delve into my example? Do I wrap things up in this paragraph? Do I have a transition here? Here is where you can beef up that word count at the micro level.

**And if all else fails**&#8230;ask someone to read your paper and point out where they wanted to know more about your ideas. It takes some of the pressure off of you (especially if you&#8217;ve already revised your paper and you&#8217;re still not hitting the bare minimum) and you benefit from reader feedback. Another way of doing this would be to read your paper out loud. Sure, you&#8217;ll feel weird about it, but after you get through that first paragraph out loud you&#8217;ll just keep going. Make notes of things that come to mind while reading.

Working on the word count is not a matter of adding words just to add words. It&#8217;s about expanding your ideas and seeing what else can be discussed.

*I should point out that these tips are useful for non-fiction, so if you&#8217;re looking for fiction pointers, let me know and I can arrange for that in upcoming weeks!*

**Dear readers, any other tips for getting that word count up?**
