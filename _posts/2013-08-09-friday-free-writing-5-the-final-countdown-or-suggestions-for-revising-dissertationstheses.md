One day I&#8217;ll treat you to the story of how I revised my dissertation in a matter of weeks&#8230;Today, however, I want to focus on students who are weeks away from submitting their dissertation or thesis to their committees and are about to lose their minds because they don&#8217;t know where to start or what to do. This post may also be of interest to students who are still months away from those big dates but want to plan ahead. I decided to put together a list of suggestions on how to handle the last few weeks of writing/revising.

First, I went to Twitter to ask my followers if they had suggestions for writers who are close to the finish line and who may be feeling overwhelmed by all the stuff they have to do before That Big Deadline Coming Up.

Sidenote: You can [read the Storify here][1], a compilation of all of the tweets I received in response to my question.

Some offered tips for keeping sane (staying focused, continue with your work routine, get a hotel room with a nice view) while others offered tips that work holistically (give yourself time to edit/proofread, plan your writing time like it&#8217;s a job, set up a routine that will get you over the hard times when inspiration and motivation have left the building). Others offered specific writing tips:

a) consider whether you need to make all the revisions your committee members ask you to.

    <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica">@literarychica</a> good cmte members should care more that you can argue your choices rather than you just defer to their demands.

b) think of your dissertation as a whole. That helps especially with the introduction and conclusion.[

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica">@literarychica</a> The shift to thinking about it as a whole is a tough but crucial one for figuring out revisions, reorganization, etc.

&nbsp;

c) Tackle the manuscript in chunks. Instead of trying to revise the whole thing at once, break it down into pieces.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica">@literarychica</a> Routine, routine, routine. Stick to schedule. Reread and edit gradually & in pieces. Easier to edit in 10-20 pg chunks.

d) Figure out your school's formatting guidelines. (Preferably, you should figure these out before you start revising.)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica">@literarychica</a> For me (this was back in 2005) it was the logistics of preparing for the school: layout, point size, margins, etc. +

  </p>
</blockquote>

&nbsp;

e) Don't try too hard. Be clinical about what needs to be done.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica">@literarychica</a> that is to say, be clinical > artistic. get it done.

</blockquote>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

f) Get feedback from other readers, preferably early in the revision process. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica">@literarychica</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/readywriting">@readywriting</a> give chapters to committee/friends as you go, so they can start reading a little at a time and give u feedback

I'll add that you should be considerate of the time of others, so make sure you give them enough time to get back to you in a timely fashion.  
g) Leave yourself tasks for the next day, so you can hit the ground running when you get back to the manuscript.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/literarychica">@literarychica</a> park on the downslope. Leave something easy at the end of each day to get you started the next one.

Now here are some of my suggestions. Admittedly, these are more focused on the craft of writing versus the holistic or personal; my tweeps covered all the tips I would have considered.

a) **Stop reading and focus on writing.** When you're weeks away from the deadline, you should focus on making your content tight and readable, not trying to figure out what other sources you can incorporate into the text.

b) **Do a reverse outline.** Instead of assuming you hit all of the points (come on, we both know you're avoiding getting your hands dirty with revision when you assume that), try looking at it from the point of view of what you already have. How does it look/sound? Does the logic of your statements on paper ring true? It's a good way to start filling gaps.

c) **Make a schedule for the last lap.** Don't try to do everything at once; it's just going to backfire. If you only have a week left, figure out all you have to do and then schedule time for the things that you know you can do. You can't do everything; you'll forget I ever said this and you will try. But you can't do everything. A good dissertation is a done dissertation.

d) **Keep an inventory (mental or otherwise) of what your biggest writing problems are.** Do you constantly mess up apostrophes? Do you slip into passive voice a lot? Did your advisor point out a mistake you make consistently? Tackle those issues first. Use the "Find" function in your word processor so you can comb through the document. Also, don't leave this for last.

e) **Tackle content before mechanics.** No one wants to revise pretty sentences. (Those pretty sentences might be just the spot that's wrong with your paragraph, for example. Catherine Prendergasts' fantastic post ["Date Your Sentences, Marry Your Paper"][2] illustrates this well.) Think about the overall idea and whether your paragraphs have a logical flow. Then you're ready to move on to

f) **Do one thing at a time.** It's tempting to try to edit, revise, and format all at once. But you're going to end up half-assing one of the three items--or maybe all three. Get your schedule set up, and dedicate time to all of these activities.

g) **Read your paper out loud or, better yet, get someone to read it or you.** You'll pick up on things you may not otherwise catch while reading it on a screen. Another option (and this one comes courtesy of my mentor): print out the whole document, get it bound, and make notes on that hard copy before you jump back into the document.

Lastly, the great Pat Thomson, who does research on doctoral students, pointed to the obvious:

Here are some links I found around the web that may also be useful. But remember: reading can sometimes be a form of procrastination! Get back to your manuscript...

-> ["Practical Advice or Writing Your Dissertation, Book, or Article"][3] <span style="font-size: 16px;">By Liena Vayzman. In this article, Vayzman reminds readers that rewriting/revising is as important as writing.</span>

-> ["Surviving a PhD - 10 Top Tips"][4] by guest blogger Alex Hope over at The Thesis Whisperer, one of my favorite blogs related to academic writing. My favorite tip? "Love to Hate Your Thesis."

-> ["Finishing Your Dissertation"][5] by columnist Renata Kobetts Miller. An oldie but a goodie. I especially liked the anecdote about her epiphany regarding her dissertation title.

Any other suggestions for tackling the last weeks of writing/revising a dissertation or thesis? Add them below or tweet me: [@literarychica][6]

*Bonus track:*

**Can't get this song out of my head. Video is a little creepy though. [Sorry about the ad at the beginning. I know how annoying they are.]
