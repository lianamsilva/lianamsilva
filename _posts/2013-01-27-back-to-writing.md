I had major plans for my &#8220;winter break.&#8221; I say &#8220;winter break&#8221; instead of just plain winter break because there is no such thing as a break when you work in student support, at least not at my school. We work year-round, and take vacation at different times. Some take time off during school breaks; some, like me, plan vacation time around conferences. I&#8217;ll try to take a few days before or after the conference off so that I can get my act together at home or so I can visit family or friends when I travel. This winter break was no different. I planned on traveling to Boston for  MLA 2013, and figured that since I was not interviewing and I was not obliged to attend all of the panels at the conference, this time post-Christmas was the equivalent of a &#8220;winter break.&#8221;

Wrong. My plans for catching up on my writing projects and my reading came tumbling down because of a toothache that later erupted into a ridiculous infection in my jaw that left me looking like a squirrel storing nuts in one cheek.

The week before New Year&#8217;s Day, I was in pain most of the week and could barely think straight. The week of Christmas I went to work, but had trouble focusing for more than a few hours at a time, and I was counting down the days to my root canal appointment. The cocktail of antibiotics and painkillers I was taking was not doing its job. When I finally went in for my root canal on December 31st, I was finally rid of the tooth ache, but then the pain and swelling in my jaw was overwhelming. I called my dentist on New Year&#8217;s Day (the day before my trip to Boston) almost in tears. He switched my antibiotic and increased the dose of ibuprofen. I made it to Boston, and was sort of okay (except I couldn&#8217;t really open my mouth to eat anything solid) until Friday, when the swelling and the pain suddenly became so excruciating I had to visit an emergency dental clinic. (Thank you, Tufts Dental School!). The emergency intervention helped; the pain was less, but it wasn&#8217;t until the week after when my jaw was almost back to normal, the pain went away, and I could actually sit at my desk at work and not think about how long until my next dose of ibuprofen.

By then, I was behind schedule on my writing projects, and it seemed like I was getting email reminder after email reminder of things I had forgotten to follow up on. I had these major plans for winter break (prep my MLA 13 presentation, make headway in my writing support for academic health centers project for work, write an essay for an online academic journal and a blog post for *Sounding Out!*) and they all came tumbling down because of one tooth.

Just one.

That one tooth took up about three weeks of my life, and so last week, my first week back to normal (no meds, no swelling, no pain) I had so much catching up to do. Sometimes I think my body falls apart in order to force me to slow down. I don&#8217;t handle slowing down very well. However, I know I need to do more of that.

This year, I have some goals (I refuse to call them resolutions) and so with that in mind I tried to get organized. One of the things I want to do is publish more of my writing. In particular, I want to have a pitch accepted at a magazine or newspaper. In order to do that, I need to keep on writing and keep on thinking and keep on reading. I also recently took on the role of Associate Editor for *[University of Venus][1] *at Inside Higher Ed. [*Sounding Out!*][2] is never far behind (I&#8217;m editing a cross-blog conversation between *Sounding Out!* and [IASPM-US][3] on the borders between sound studies and popular music studies) and I am already thinking ahead to proposing a panel for MLA 2014. I like having these mini-projects on my docket, especially after years of working mostly on ONE major project. But I need to get organized if I want to keep my writing going&#8211;and also enjoy a break from time to time.

I&#8217;m taking time (outside of my 40 hours at work) for &#8220;writing projects&#8221; and &#8220;personal projects.&#8221; As an alternative academic, I work a full work week, and I can&#8217;t fit in my personal writing projects into my writing time at work. (I&#8217;m fortunate enough that my boss allows me some time to work on my research, but I can&#8217;t get away with calling all of my writing &#8220;research.&#8221;)  I&#8217;m taking this plan out for a test run. Maybe if I don&#8217;t obsess over writing every day (like Jo Van Every encourages [in her blog post &#8220;Principles and Rules&#8221;][4]) and focus on doing things regularly  that will further my writing projects, that will take away some of the frustration I feel when I look at my schedule at the end of the week.

I&#8217;m back to writing.
