It seems my blogging schedule is all off now! I didn&#8217;t blog last week on Monday, I blogged last Saturday instead of Friday, and this Monday I didn&#8217;t post either. Oh boy. But I actually did post, honest! On Monday I blogged over at [Sounding Out!][1]. My latest post is titled &#8220;[Eye Candy: The Absence of the Female Voice in Sports Talk Radio.][2]&#8221; If you&#8217;re interested in sound studies, you listen to sports talk radio, you are interested in feminist media studies, or you like to reading interesting analyses of pop culture, then my latest post is right up your alley! It&#8217;s a little more academic than my typical blog post here, but I try to keep the jargon to a minimum.

Enjoy! Also, come back tomorrow for a freshly-minted blog post. I promise I&#8217;ll post on time.
