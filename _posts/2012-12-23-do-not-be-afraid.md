2012 was a good year. I got my PhD, I got married, and I got my first full-time job. (Yes, my first one; being a professional student will do that to you.) For the first time in a long time, I feel I am in a good place. However, I feel like I want to do more. I want *a challenge*.

A few months ago [I wondered about what taking risks in writing looks like][1]. I attempted to do #AcWriMo (Academic Writing Month) to challenge myself in my writing. I did not meet my large goal, but I did get back into the daily writing habit, which was one of my long-term goals. However, I still feel like I need a challenge&#8230;The PhD was such a major dream for me, and now that I&#8217;m here I have all this energy I can use in other projects. I just don&#8217;t know where to focus.

I have projects, I do. I have [*Sounding Out!*][2] which has grown beyond our wildest dreams&#8211;from a blog run by three sound aficionados to a full-blown web presence that showcases cutting edge writing about sound every Monday (and we&#8217;ve haven&#8217;t missed a beat in over two years). I have a long-term research project at the Writing Center where I work, a project on extra-curricular writing support at academic medical/health centers. I have a dissertation chapter I have to turn into an article this holiday season. I have my [regular blogging duties][3] for[ University of Venus][4] over at the higher education website [*Inside Higher Ed*][5]. But it feels very comfortable.

I wasn&#8217;t sure how to articulate this feeling (or whether I was just being fidgety) until I came across Rania Anderson&#8217;s[ &#8220;Successful Women Make All the RIGHT Mistakes.&#8221;][6] She mentions that her boss responded to a project she was working on by complimenting the mistakes she had made, and told her she should embrace those mistakes, &#8220;pushing the outer edges of what [she] knew, working toward more challenging goals and not worrying when some aspects of a project or assignment did not go perfectly.&#8221; I promptly tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">

  </p>
</blockquote>

I realized that the projects I have on my plate are projects I know I am good at. It also made me realize that the reason I haven&#8217;t embraced my freelance (side) job is that I am afraid of failure. I am afraid of something I don&#8217;t know how to work. Academia? I can handle that. I can navigate it. But freelance work, pitching my writing to broader outlets, getting started on that Kansas City soundscape project I&#8217;ve been dreaming about? All of that is a big question mark. *Where do I begin?*

2013 will be about not being afraid, of trying something new. Maybe that something new is pitching my writing to a non-academic venue. Maybe that something new is a blog series. Maybe that something new is embracing my freelance side. Maybe that something new is not fearing the questions, but staring them in the face.

**Dear readers and writers: what would you pursue if you did not fear failure?**

P.S.: Because now this song is stuck in my head&#8230;
