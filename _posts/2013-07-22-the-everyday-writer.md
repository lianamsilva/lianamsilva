I was away. And now I am back.

I spent three weeks traveling and/or hanging out with family and friends. That gave me some time away from writing and, especially, from blogging. (I haven&#8217;t blogged [since June 28th, 2013][1].) I missed it though, the familiar routine of putting ideas down, of making my way through words and picking the ones I wanted.

That doesn&#8217;t mean I didn&#8217;t write. I typed emails, I edited articles and blog posts, I even [drafted my part of a conference paper][2] (for [Digital Humanities 2013][3]). I even tried to put down some words in two separate blog post drafts. But I eventually got caught up in my travels and forgot about writing. Or rather, I allowed myself to do other things other than write.

Some writers will say that you should want to write every day if you&#8217;re a real writer (here&#8217;s [McSweeney&#8217;s take on that][4]), that you should want to die if you&#8217;re not writing in order to say you&#8217;re a real writer. I beg to differ. Sometimes I do need a break from writing. Writing is hard. I think trials of authenticity are silly anyway, but what makes me feel like I am a writer is that even when I am away from writing I want to write.

So yes, I did think about writing while I was away. And I missed my daily dose of freewriting and my weekly schedule of blogging. I guess this is my Everyday now. That&#8217;s not a bad thing.

I&#8217;ve talked before [about the idea of coming to terms with being a writer][5] (instead of becoming a writer, as if there was a magic &#8220;minimum&#8221; that you had to meet in order to call yourself that) but I still sometimes struggle with calling myself a writer when others ask. While on vacation, a family member told someone (in front of me) that I was a professor. It stung a little only because it reminded me of another time, a time when I **was** teaching. I corrected her.

> &#8220;Actually I don&#8217;t teach anymore.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Oh? What are you doing now?&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a freelance editor&#8230;&#8221;

After a brief explanation that I&#8217;d decided to go freelance when no jobs popped up in Houston, the conversation died and we all moved on to something else.

Here&#8217;s the thing: I feel a lot more comfortable telling people I am an editor. I&#8217;ve been doing it for years. I&#8217;ve edited in different capacities, and for once I feel comfortable charging people for my services. But telling people I am a writer? It feels like I&#8217;m saying a secret out loud to a friend in a public place where no one knows either of you.

On Tuesday, I walked along Fifth Avenue in New York City with my husband, as I was talking about dreams and how he had accomplished his dream. On the other hand, I told him, I had switched dreams. He said, but you&#8217;re trying to accomplish your dreams aren&#8217;t you? I thought of saying something about my dream of becoming a professor, but instead I responded, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m working on becoming a writer.&#8221; Then I said, &#8220;actually I am a writer. I&#8217;m just trying to get more of my work out there.&#8221;

Amid the crowd of folks milling about Fifth Avenue (we were headed to the Met) I said it, out loud. My heart tightened a little bit, slightly nervous about what I had just said. I was afraid someone (maybe my husband) would stop me and say, &#8220;what do you mean, writer?&#8221; Kind of like when he argues with me about whether I&#8217;m a New Yorker or not. But he didn&#8217;t. He didn&#8217;t argue with me, or ask for explanations as to why I considered myself a writer. Actually, no one asked for an explanation.

I wonder what keeps me from embracing it. No, scratch that. I know what keeps me from embracing it: it&#8217;s the sensation that I am pretending to be a writer and somehow I&#8217;ll be discovered&#8211;my Imposter Syndrome flaring up. I tend to feel like I can&#8217;t claim it until I get something published, but even I know that&#8217;s not fair to the several online venues that have already published my writing.

Maybe &#8220;writer&#8221; isn&#8217;t so much a career as a state of being, for me at least. As I reenter Life Back in Houston, I yearn for my daily routine, the thing that will get me back on track. I can&#8217;t wait to sit down and write again, in the same place at the same time.
