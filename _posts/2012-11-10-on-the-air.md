This Monday, I will be on the air with Ben from [Literature Review HQ][1] to talk about the writing process&#8211;specifically, I will be talking about understanding one&#8217;s writing process in order to improve one&#8217;s writing. It&#8217;s a free webinar but you have to register online in order to participate. ([Click here][2] if you&#8217;re interested.)

If you know me and/or you&#8217;ve been reading this blog for a while, you know that once upon a time I didn&#8217;t have any confidence in my ability to teach others about writing. I thought that I had no training, so I shouldn&#8217;t be left alone in a classroom to talk about writing, let alone teach writing. Literature is more my thing, I would say. I can teach literature better than writing&#8230;but my department was not about to change my courses. In fact, I didn&#8217;t get to teach my own literature course until my last semester of funding&#8230;an experience that affected me deeply: I enjoyed it so much that ever since I have been searching for the next opportunity to do it again&#8230;

At any rate, I learned the hard way how to teach writing. I watched others. I asked questions. I looked up exercises. I tried a textbook. I tried another textbook. I assigned a paper. I changed my mind. I assigned a different paper. I went back to the first assignment. I kept this up until my last semester as a writing instructor.

After my last stint in the writing classroom, I moved to the writing center, where I was supposed to specialize in graduate student writing. Although I am technically a program associate, I read a lot about writing and break down writing to the writers who come see me. I have learned that I can actually explain writing in a way that may seem obvious to me, but that is not obvious to others.Interestingly, I feel a lot more confident talking to writers about writing than I ever was in front of the classroom.  Part of why I feel confident in that is because I have always loved writing. I admire strong sentences, interesting images, innovative ideas, different approaches. I love reading strong, smart, concise writing. My love of writing brought me here.

All this to say that I am humbled that Ben wants me to talk to his readers, and I am grateful that I can help other writers achieve their goals. I&#8217;ve come a long way. If only my students could see me now.

P.S.: This is unrelated to the podcast, but while thinking of a title for this post all I could think of was Regina Spektor&#8217;s &#8220;On The Radio.&#8221; Enjoy.
