**The title of this post plays off a line in  Vampire Weekend&#8217;s &#8220;Oxford Comma&#8221; (see below) and Scrub&#8217;s Elliott Reed and her favorite curse word: &#8220;frick.&#8221;*

This week one of my tweeps on Twitter asked me about punctuation placement regarding quotation marks. As some of you may know, in the United States the standard is to put *some* punctuation inside quotation marks. Grammar Girl Mignon Fogarty [offers this tip][1]: &#8220;*inside *the U.S., periods and commas go *inside *quotation marks.&#8221; In the UK, however, punctuation goes outside of quotation marks.

Ben Yagoda at Slate [points out][2] how it&#8217;s becoming more and more common to leave punctuation outside of quotation marks, if only because it doesn&#8217;t make sense to insert a punctuation mark that is not part of the original text. He also mentions how writing code may have also influenced this shift to punctuation outside of the quotation marks: the placement of a period inside or outside quotation marks can make a difference in code.

Why do Americans put periods or commas (but nothing else, mind you!) outside of quotation marks? Yagoda quotes Rosemary Feal, Executive Director of MLA, who says that it&#8217;s related to how the text may have looked weird (a long long time ago) to have the comma or period left outside of the quotation mark.  Now, he surmises, it&#8217;s more about being used to the placement instead of actually about aesthetics, but neither MLA nor The Chicago Manual of Style will be changing their placement any time soon.

*Now, how do I feel about the matter?*

I&#8217;m going with commas and periods inside quotation marks, if anything because of habit. I understand how logical it is to leave both marks outside of quotation marks, but at this point I am not about to change how I write to make a point about how it doesn&#8217;t make sense. In formal, editorial settings the practice remains unchanged for the most part, and as an editor for two blogs I can&#8217;t start a one-person revolution on punctuation. However, I cannot say that American usage of commas and periods outside of quotation marks is right or wrong compared to British usage; I&#8217;m not going to fight you if you follow the British way. I think the important thing to keep in mind is the rationale for punctuation and usage and think about why we place certain kinds of punctuation where.

However, remember that both American and British usage call for exclamation marks, question marks, semicolons, and colons *that aren&#8217;t part of the original quotation* to sit outside of the quotation marks.

**Exception to all of these rules: if the quotation includes only a letter or number, in American usage the period and comma stay outside.*

Ultimately, I want writers to be more mindful of how they write and why they write in certain ways, not just in terms of content or organization but also in terms of spelling, punctuation, syntax, etc. Also, be consistent. We can&#8217;t have a mess of commas running around papers, can we?

**Before I go, for funsies:**

You can always try Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s approach: [almost no punctuation at all][3].

*Bonus track:*

Because I like songs that refer to punctuation. Feel free to add your favorite songs about punctuation in the comments!
