Every time I tweet some random observation regarding my work as a freelancer, I hashtag it #thefreelancelife. I use hashtags not just as a way to categorize tweets but also for comedic effect. However, this hashtag is starting to reflect more and more what goes on in my new&#8230;um&#8230;career?

I hesitate to type that out.

Profession? Job? Let&#8217;s go with &#8220;career.&#8221;

Yes, I have decided to embrace freelancing. I&#8217;ve always had the &#8220;editing services&#8221; tab at the top of my old blog, but now I am doing that full time. I&#8217;m also trying to break into freelance writing.

The editing part I feel more comfortable about, especially because I know many freelance editors, and I have been working as a freelance editor for years (albeit on a part-time, I-need-some-extra-cash basis). Freelance writing, on the other hand, is a little scarier. I took a course last March on [writing personal essays and op-eds ][1]and pitching them to different outlets, and even though the course was wonderful, I took it while I was working, and so I didn&#8217;t get all that I wanted to get out of it. I wanted a piece that was ready to sell. I got feedback on something that I had written before&#8230;for my blog.

So freelance writing scares me. Yes, I said it, it scares me. It&#8217;s a new thing, a new world (to use a worn cliche) to me. And I am a creature of habit.

Being a creature of habit does not mean I don&#8217;t like new things&#8211;in fact, I embrace challenges. But I also hesitate, flinch, worry, dip one toe in the water and retreat for a moment.

What I do when that happens is I research. Yes, research. I look up information. I read articles. I chat with others. I ask questions aloud. I reach out. This &#8220;research&#8221; bit is probably me just stalling, but it&#8217;s comfortable too. I like gathering the information. But the same way that eventually you need to stop gathering and start writing that dissertation/paper/article, I need to eventually stop researching and start working.

Noah Davis&#8217;s article in *The Awl* appeared this week in the nick of time where I need to start shifting away from fear to action. In his article &#8220;[Freelance Writing Online: What Are You Worth?][2]&#8221; he addresses how much freelance writers get paid for their writing, but he also delves into deeper issues about freelance writing. For example, he points out that many freelance writers don&#8217;t have mentors to teach them about the craft and the business:

> But the destruction of the job market hurts not only the quantity, but the quality. For one thing, it reduces the number of mentors. &#8220;There&#8217;s a whole generation of kids who are really bright and who are interested in this work. None of them have been trained as reporters and it&#8217;s disastrous,&#8221; said David Samuels&#8230;

Although in the above quotation Samuels focuses on reporters, it&#8217;s safe to say that freelance writers who work in all genres would benefit from mentoring. The mentoring aspect reminds me of academia, the work context I&#8217;m most familiar with.

In academia, a lot of information and cultural capital is passed down through mentors and advisors. For women academics, mentorship is especially valuable, as my fellow blogger Janni Aragon [has talked about][3] at U Venus. For me, graduate classes taught me much about content. However, my conversations with my advisor and my mentor (who still coach me from afar), with professors, with advanced graduate students, helped prepare me in a way for the world of academia. I miss that kind of support right now.

Freelance writing also feeds a little bit into [Imposter Syndrome][4]. I was always a little uncomfortable with academia (and [the recent book on women in academia][5] hints at why) for being a woman, for being a person of color, for being a first-generation college student; I always felt like someone would uncover me and point me out as a fraud. I am slowly becoming more comfortable with my academic self&#8211;and ironically that coincides with my crafting an alternative academic identity. However, now that I am exploring the freelancer writer waters, Imposter Syndrome is flaring up. I feel like I am an academic writer pretending to be a *writer* writer&#8230;whatever what means. (See, it doesn&#8217;t even make sense when I type it.)

Samuels asks, &#8220;who are you going to learn your craft from? What structures are going to support you in doing work that&#8217;s any good? And how are you going to know if it&#8217;s any good?&#8221; That&#8217;s where I am: looking for the structures to support me as I jump into this new endeavor. So far I have connected with a few academics-turned-freelancers on twitter who are also starting out. Also, [Anne Trubek][6] has been a great help; she&#8217;s an academic-turned-freelance writer too, and committed to helping other women writers to break into print. What I&#8217;m looking for now is a place to nurture my ideas.

Yes, the writing coach sometimes needs someone to coach her writing spirit.
