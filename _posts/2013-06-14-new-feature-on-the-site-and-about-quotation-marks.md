Sometimes I get inspired. Sometimes I do something about that.

This week I was inspired to add a feature to this site: a question box for readers to leave questions about writing, over at the sidebar. I enjoy talking about writing and figuring out the little details regarding grammar, mechanics, style, etc. Yes, I actually like to immerse myself in reading about the nuances of writing. (I know, it&#8217;s a little geeky, but I&#8217;m okay with that&#8230;) So I thought adding a box where readers could leave questions for me would be a way to get conversations about writing going. I&#8217;m hoping to do this feature on Fridays; any questions I get during the week will be answered then.

Also, I need a snazzy name for this new feature. I&#8217;m usually very good with snazzy names or titles, but I&#8217;m at a loss for this one. Suggestions are welcome!

**So here we go, our first question!**

*What is the correct usage of the single quotation marks, or two apostrophes to frame a quote? Often you see the double quotation marks, but when is it okay to use the single? Is it okay?*

In the United States, we use double quotation marks to set off a quotation. The quotation marks within quotation marks are tricky, and I have seen this problem often in papers. Oftentimes I see the double quotation within double quotations, which is a no-no. It&#8217;s just plain confusing. So, within a quotation you would use single quotation marks in order to point out a quotation within a quotation. Say for example if you&#8217;re quoting someone who&#8217;s quoting someone else. You would signal that quotation within a quotation with single quotation marks.

  * &#8220;Sara said, &#8216;I&#8217;m really not about that life.&#8217; But I disagree. She&#8217;s all about that life.&#8221;

Another reason to use single quotation marks is, say, if the quotation mentions a title that would commonly be enclosed in double quotation marks. The double quotation marks are switched to single quotation marks.

  * &#8220;I&#8217;m going to write a song,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and it&#8217;s going to be called &#8216;I Ain&#8217;t About That Life.&#8217;&#8221;

Also, in that last example, both quotation marks close at the end of the sentence. Therefore, there is a single quotation mark and a double quotation mark. It looks like three marks together. That&#8217;s okay.

Again, this dynamic applies to writing in a US context. In the UK, for example, this would be reversed because single quotations are used like double quotations are used in the United States.
