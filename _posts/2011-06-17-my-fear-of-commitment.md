**I was inspired to write this post after I read this post on [The Script Lab][1]: [&#8220;To Be Or Not To Be&#8230;A Writer.&#8221;][2]*

If you&#8217;ve been keeping track of this blog, you know I am currently unemployed. Until recently, [I was a college instructor][3], but I cashed out my chips in order to find gainful employment that would also be satisfying intellectually. (Not that teaching isn&#8217;t challenging enough; it&#8217;s just that I wasn&#8217;t getting paid a living wage as an adjunct.) I started this blog as a way to continue to develop my writing beyond academic genres, but it has quickly become about more than just that. It made me realize something I had stashed away a long time ago: my aspirations of becoming a writer. I took the opportunity that unemployment gave me and I decide to embrace this new identity (an identity that isn&#8217;t really new).

However, any up-and-coming writer will tell you that you can&#8217;t live off of words alone. The life of the mind is just a myth, you know. So as I plot my next blog post (for here and for *[Sounding Out!][4]*), I&#8217;m also plotting my next move in my career. I am, after all, unemployed. Even though I wasn&#8217;t afraid to shout out to the cyber universe that &#8220;I am a writer, hear me roar,&#8221; I am afraid of committing to a new career path altogether.

You see, for the past few years I have been developing my identity as an academic. Ever since I arrived in adulthood, that&#8217;s what i thought I&#8217;d be doing: [getting a PhD][5] and teaching at the university level&#8211;never mind that the reason why I decided to major in English was because I wanted to write. I didn&#8217;t know of creative writing programs when I was in high school. I figured that if I wanted to become a writer I should study how other people write. Once I was in the program, I submerged myself into literary criticism, and that detour has taken me all the way to today. I invested a lot of time and energy into that professional identity; my dissertation is supposed to cement it. On the other hand, my teaching is supposed to show my commitment to higher ed. But when higher ed refuses me a living wage because I&#8217;m not tenure-track, what do I do? (And plenty will say I can only be tenure-track if I have a PhD. What about the thousands of adjuncts with PhDs who aren&#8217;t tenure-track? Don&#8217;t get me started&#8230;)

As I branch out to the world outside of the ivory tower and look for other jobs, my concern is: how do I present myself? Who am I? This was exacerbated by applying for a teaching position this week at a local university. I put together my Linkedin profile thinking about freelance writing, but when I wrote my cover letter for this teaching job, I thought: what will they think of this non-academic profile? Academia will see any attempt to have a life outside of it as a weakness, as a reason to not hire you&#8230;or so other academics say.

And here lies my dilemma: as I build my Linkedin profile and consider whether to revive my Facebook profile for the sake of networking, I wonder if I should brand myself as a freelancer. Whereas there are plenty of academics who have built an online presence around their academic lives, I fear building an online identity around a non-academic self. I&#8217;m not sure about leaving academia forever. On the other hand, I feel like I have to commit to *something*: freelance editing, social media specialist, academic, college professor. How about building a site where both of my identities merge? Will employers think I&#8217;m just not committed enough?

I guess a career should not dictate who we are. Our lives continue when we leave work. One of the things that upset me about academia was that a lot of the people around me didn&#8217;t know when to stop talking shop. They were always in academic mode; sometimes I wanted to talk about shoes. Shoes! Because they&#8217;re pretty, they make my legs look fantastic, and they can make or break an outfit. Or sometimes I wanted to talk about tv. I love tv. I love it! And it doesn&#8217;t make me any smarter or stupider than the next professor.

But our jobs make up a big part of our identities. So much of who we are is wrapped up in what we do, whether we like it or not. And I&#8217;m not ready to let go of my academic side, not just yet.

So who am I? For now, I&#8217;m settling on writer. It doesn&#8217;t pay the bills, but it feels true.
