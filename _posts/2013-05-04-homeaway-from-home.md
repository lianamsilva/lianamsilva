It&#8217;s been an emotional week. This week was my second-to-last week at work. It was also the week of the 20-day mark: 20 days until we move to Houston. This also means it&#8217;s been 70 days since I haven&#8217;t been in the same house with my husband, let alone the same state. Distance makes the heart grow fonder? More like &#8220;distance makes the mind go a little batty, especially when you haven&#8217;t gotten a good night&#8217;s sleep in days.&#8221;

Yup, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at.

It hasn&#8217;t been an emotional roller coaster. It has been more like an emotional game show:

> &#8220;What will happen once our contestant gets to work?&#8221;  
> &#8220;How many hours of sleep do you think our contestant can lose and still stay functional, audience?&#8221;  
> &#8220;10:00 pm, and the daughter is still up! I&#8217;m sorry, ma&#8217;am, you bet the daughter would sleep by 10, but she is still up. Sorry. You get some excellent consolation prizes though.&#8221;  
> &#8220;When her husband calls her at 11:00 pm, is Liana capable of having a normal conversation? Survey said&#8230;&#8221;

And so on.

I don&#8217;t think this week has been crazier than usual. It&#8217;s just that this week I officially got antsy: I wanted to leave, I wanted to stay home, I wanted to be in Houston, I wanted to hug everyone at work, I wanted to buy takeout every day and not cook, I wanted to hide from people. I argued with my husband about him forgetting that I had planned a Goodbye Happy Hour for this weekend. One morning I woke up, feeling sad, something I hadn&#8217;t felt in a long time. I&#8217;ve had to deal with toddler grumpiness at 1:00 am, which in turn made me a little grumpy. And then yesterday I left my last All-Staff meeting at the main campus, happy and melancholic, all at once.

I tried my best to create some sort of stability in my daughter&#8217;s life and in mine. I came up with weekend activities for us to do. I tried to put her to bed at a reasonable time every night. I made breakfast for us on weekends and let her watch tv after dinner. I played my husband&#8217;s broadcast in the kitchen while I cleaned up, so that at least his voice was in the house, even if he was in a different time zone. At work I continued to pack my schedule at work, making sure I covered all bases before my departure. I planned lunch with friends. I got my hair cut. I willed myself to continue to wake up at 5:00 am to write, like I used to before my husband left. 90 days seemed like they would come and go in no time.

But this week I realized we were so close to Houston and yet so far away from Moving Day. We&#8217;re home but we&#8217;re not. Maybe it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re surrounded by boxes and empty bookcases. Maybe it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t gotten a good night&#8217;s sleep in over a week. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a little anxious. Maybe it&#8217;s because I miss having my husband around and the phone no longer <del>seems to bridge</del> substitutes the distance between us. We&#8217;re still hundreds of miles away, and we feel it like a cut in the skin.

Today I&#8217;m feeling better. The idea of time with friends this weekend has lifted my spirits. And next week will swoosh by before I even have the chance to sit down and think about how many days are left. However, this separation hasn&#8217;t been easy. I&#8217;m leaving this post here to honor not just the good times but also the tough times. They happen too.
