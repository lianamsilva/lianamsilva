    Lately I&#8217;ve been thinking a whole lot more about writing, perhaps because I&#8217;m leaving my job at the writing center where I have been for the past year and a half and I&#8217;m trying to figure out what is my next step professionally. This is one of the things I like about being an alternative academic: it&#8217;s not about a particular job but about career moves. Alternative academic is more of a career than a job right now. And so I&#8217;m thinking about my next career move. As a friend told me this weekend, this move to Texas has given me some freedom in a way.

    But I&#8217;ll miss my job at the writing center. Firstly, the writing center showed me that there was a life for me outside of the classroom. It also taught me that there were folks out there who appreciated the work I did, something I rarely got as a professor (and with no sense of whether I was doing well or doing not so well I always teetered over to &#8220;I could do better&#8221;&#8211;a vicious cycle). It felt <i>good </i>to be appreciated, to hear people say, &#8220;Wow that was helpful. <i>Thank you</i>.&#8221; And I needed that in my professional life. In a broader sense, the writing center opened up possibilities for me. More importantly, I like what I do: I like working with writers, talking with them about their writing process, coaching them to their finish lines, listening to their concerns, and sometimes even pointing out when they&#8217;re overthinking their writing and they just need to sit down and write. (Yes, I have been that person who says &#8220;you need to stop reading and start writing.&#8221;) In a way, this job appeared just in the nick of time, a time when I was floating around, unsure about this thing called academia, with half a dissertation left to write.

    All of that to say, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about writing in part because I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my job and I&#8217;ve been thinking about what&#8217;s next and what I can do in Houston. And so lately I&#8217;ve also been thinking about my professional identity as a scholar, particularly about publications and getting my academic writing act together. (You may want to check out <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/university-venus/academic-writer%E2%80%99s-block-matter-form">my latest at U Venus</a> about academic writer&#8217;s block if you haven&#8217;t yet.) That leads me to think about the dissertation, that big manuscript that&#8217;s supposed to be the rough draft of the first book you&#8217;re supposed to publish when you enter the tenure track. (<i>I say &#8220;the tenure track&#8221;  because I&#8217;m under the impression that alternative academic jobs don&#8217;t usually require you to publish a book the first four years into your job. Correct me if I am wrong. Seriously.</i>) However, I am not on the tenure track so I&#8217;m not under the pressure of transforming my dissertation into a manuscript. That doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t, though. Seriously, I spent almost three years on the thing, and produced 200 polished pages. (<em>Dear a</em><i>cademics: don&#8217;t laugh at my 200 pages. You, in the corner, I see you snickering.</i>) So I want to do something with it&#8211;and if you read <a href="http://wordsaremygame.com/2013/02/28/write-she-said/">my last post here</a>, I confessed to wanting to write a book someday.

  So here it goes: I have an idea for revising the dissertation. It probably will look nothing like what it looks like right now. But that&#8217;s okay; that&#8217;s what revision is all about. I want to weave in my own story as a traveling migrant with my research and analysis of representations of home. At this point I can do whatever I want with it, so why not do what I feel like doing, which is talk about what it feels like to have different iterations of home?</p>

  At this point I&#8217;m looking to read other kinds of intellectual narratives, whether tradebooks or academic publications. Any suggestions, readers?</p>

  P.S.: If you have leads on Houston jobs for writers, that works too. Joking. Kind of. Really, I&#8217;m joking. Unless you aren&#8217;t. Ok, just hit me up in the comments section. Let&#8217;s go with that.
