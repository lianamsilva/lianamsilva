As you may already know, I quit adjuncting in order to a) find a job that pays me a living wage b) finish my dissertation. (And if you don&#8217;t know, you can read all about it [here][1].) As of Friday, I&#8217;m officially no longer a college instructor. It&#8217;s a weird feeling because for the past six years that&#8217;s been a major component of my identity. Sure, I&#8217;m a grad student (my brother likes to say I&#8217;m the world&#8217;s oldest student, but [I beg to differ][2]), I&#8217;m a mom (a new identity I&#8217;m still trying to figure out), I&#8217;m a writer (a hat I hadn&#8217;t tried on in a while, but one that feels oddly like home). I briefly poured beer for extra cash some summers during my grad coursework. ([It. Was. Awesome.][3]) But in terms of employment, my main identity has been teacher/educator/instructor/professor. And to all of a sudden scratch that off my business card is weird.

My teaching career ended on this note: me, furiously adding and subtracting numbers, anxiously looking at the clock every few minutes, absentmindedly skipping meals while I finished up grades in the knick of time in an empty office on campus. Wash rinse repeat: this is how my semester always ends. And to be honest, I dislike it. Grading is an intense, psychological activity for me that I&#8217;d prefer a hundred times to not do. In case you were wondering, my love for teaching has nothing to do with my distaste for grading.

If you know any college instructors&#8211;I&#8217;m not going to overgeneralize here&#8211;you know that in general we don&#8217;t like grading. Some of us put up with it, some of us do it all in one sitting or in small clumps, others tweet about it in an effort to stay sane, but WE ALL DISLIKE GRADING. Example: during the first few weeks of May, several of my college composition instructor tweeps came up with blog posts on grading, and a glance at their posts will show y0u how much we struggle with this part of the profession. Click[ here][4] for readywriting&#8217;s take on grade-grubbing, click [here][5] for Too Hot To Teach&#8217;s archive of posts on grading,and click [here][6] for The Picky Girl&#8217;s post on end of semester blues. Grading is a very unpleasant activity; even for those of us who enjoy coming to class and engaging our students in lively discussions about the subject of the day, grading is one thing we have to put up with. And that&#8217;s how my teaching career ended, with grading.

Well, that&#8217;s what I call ending on a high note.

I&#8217;m no different from other comp instructors in that I dislike grading, true that. But grading flips my life around, and I&#8217;m generally in a stinky mood for several days. (Yes, I live with <del>another person</del>other people, and I don&#8217;t have the luxury to be in a stinky mood. But it happens. Go ahead, sue me&#8230;or worse, tell my mom.). I go from blissfully ignoring the papers for a day or two to fretting over how long it&#8217;s taking me to read this one paper over and over and over again because I&#8217;m so tired from reading, writing, taking care of baby, commuting, and meeting with students at school. For days I feel anxious, I don&#8217;t sleep well at night, and I can&#8217;t focus on other things (like my dissertation) because I have this ongoing monologue in the back of my mind:

> Ok, another 30 minutes and then back to grading. Oh shoot, I have to make lunch. Lunch can wait. Ugh, no, lunch cannot wait! But if I have lunch, I can only take 15 minutes for lunch because Miss E is going to wake up&#8230;oh crap, just stop working on this chapter and get to grading already. You can have lunch when Miss E wakes up&#8230;wait, what? Ok, what was I writing? And there it goes, my train of thought. Bye bye.

Yeah. No wonder I can&#8217;t sleep: I cant stop thinking about grading. And I know I&#8217;m not the only one: I remember talking to another composition instructor (is it a coincidence that she was contingent faculty just like I used to be?) and telling her how I kept on procrastinating on grading. She confided that her significant other knew she had papers to grade because she would be in a bad mood.

I could learn to manage my time better (even though I am already a slave to my calendar and my lists of things to do). Or I could leave less comments on my students papers (although my experience is that the less comments I leave the less revision they do). Or I could assign less writing throughout the semester (which defeats the purpose of a writing class, right?). Or I could get my butt in gear, become a big-shot professor, and hire a bunch of TAs to do my grading for me while I sit atop my Ivory Tower throne. But the truth is, I still need to grade them.

So, hypothetical situation: What if we abolished grading forever? What if we didn&#8217;t have to deal with reading a student&#8217;s essay over and over again to try to figure out what letter to give it? What if I didn&#8217;t need to sit down and argue with a rubric about what letter a student &#8220;earned&#8221;? What if I didn&#8217;t have to put up with emails from students telling me that they didn&#8217;t deserve the grade I gave them? What if I could just read a student&#8217;s writing and talk to them about their strengths and weaknesses, and really focus on helping them improve instead of thinking about what letter grade this falls under? What if I could just give them a narrative evaluation instead of a letter grade? Perhaps this has a lot to do with the nature of the first year composition course, or maybe it&#8217;s related to traditional notions about grading.

I admit that part of my frustration comes from feeling like I am powerless during grading. I no longer control my day and how I spend it; instead, those papers in my Dropbox folder control it. I need to plan my day around grading. It keeps me from leaving the house and enjoying a day out with my family. If I choose to go out with my family instead of grading, on the ride home I&#8217;m thinking of all the grading I need to get done before I go to sleep when I really wanted to stay up with my boyfriend (who has an intense schedule of his own because he works in baseball) and watch a show.

I&#8217;ve tried dealing with my dislike for the grading process in several ways.  I&#8217;ll be posting on my attempts later this week. But for now I&#8217;ll say that if I ever teach <insert name of first year college composition course at random school> again I want to try a workshop-style writing class. I&#8217;d love to find a way to focus on the writing instead of the letter at the end of the semester. A girl can dream, right?

I will miss teaching. I will miss thinking about readings for my students, writing assignment descriptions, coming up with interesting writing activities for them.  I will not miss grading, not one bit. But I will not look back in anger.
