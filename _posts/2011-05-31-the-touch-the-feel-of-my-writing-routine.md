(Insert Zooey Deschanel singing about cotton, but not really singing about cotton.)

I am lazy, I admit it. My boyfriend claims that if I am as lazy as I say, I wouldn’t be working on my PhD. This is true. However, I also know that I am prone to laziness; when it comes to washing dishes, picking up my clothes (yes, sometimes I act like I&#8217;m five years old), even emailing people back, I can sometimes be super lazy. It all boils down to time management. If I don’t have it in my schedule for the day, or if I pack too many things into my schedule, there are things that probably won&#8217;t get done. Without a schedule, any day can be a total waste for me.

Now, no day is a total waste. C&#8217;mon now. Life happens when you don’t plan it, the old adage says. Or, life happens after I get upset that I can’t get the work done that I planned on getting done today. But the truth is, I don’t remember the last time that I made a conscious decision to just not do anything for a whole day. It would be nice to do that. In fact, I plan on taking a few days off after I finish Chapter 2.

I’m sure there is a lot of merit to taking time off to not do anything. (For example, a holiday like yesterday would have been an awesome day for that). But I’m working on my dissertation. I’ve been “working”* on my dissertation for approximately two years. Honestly, I am mentally exhausted from thinking about it ALL THE TIME. (This is why people who are working on their dissertations don&#8217;t like talking about them.) But I need to get it done, and I need to get it done pronto.

In order to get that bad boy done, I need a schedule to keep me focused. I use schedules on a regular basis, but as of January I have vowed to make time for the dissertation every day. I usually write a list of things to do out at some point before I go to bed, brief reminders of what I have to do tomorrow. My Google calendar (synced to my phone) tells me everyday (except Sunday) is a dissertation day. Now that classes are over, I can spend more time writing and reading than before, so everyday (except Sunday) is literally a dissertation day. I have been more productive in the past week than I have been in any given week the last two years. (Unemployment makes this possible. That’s the lead lining on this puffy cloud). How have I become productive? Routine.

You see, because I am the laziest grad student out there, I need a routine to force me to work. I’m not the first writer to point this out. But a routine helps jolt me out of “lemme check my email, again” to “Let me hammer this last paragraph of seemingly nonsense out before I head home.” Routines and schedules are my friends. So are Post-its. But that&#8217;s not the point.

Problem is, my boyfriend and I do not lead normal, scheduled lives where I can insert writing and research into the same time every day. We have an 11-month old baby. As she is 11 months old, her days are not longer as well-structured as they were when she was, I don&#8217;t know, 4 months old? Also, my boyfriend works in baseball. If (before) my days revolved around my teaching schedule, they also revolve around his: when is the team back in town? when do they have an off day? when does he go to the ballpark? Oh, he&#8217;s going to the station today? So my work routine changes week per week. Sometimes this makes me crabby.

Let me give you an example: last week I had planned on leaving early to the library, as I had been doing since classes ended. When I&#8217;m going to the library usually leave between 9:30 and 10 am. By 10:30 I am hard at work. By 12 I am heading home (a lot gets done in that brief time). My library routine makes me happy. I actually feel smiley when I drive down to the half-empty Plaza district en route to the KC Library Plaza Branch. Last Thursday I woke up with that in mind&#8230;until my boyfriend told me he had to work at 9 am. I was upset. Very upset.

He reminded me that my day didn’t have to be a waste just because I didn’t get up early to work. The man is a smart man. But the truth is, my routine keeps me sane. It is the one thing I can point to in my success at writing Chapter Two in a matter of months. Chapter 1 took me a year. And it wasn’t even that good. So a chapter in a few months? This is awesome. I have learned that even if I have great critical thinking skills, it&#8217;s not even half the battle when it comes to getting one chapter done. When baseball took away my routine that morning (when in doubt, always blame Major League Baseball, that&#8217;s what I always say), I was frustrated, to say the least. So much time wasted the last two years! And you want to mess with yet another day?! Over my dead body, Baseball! Harumpf.

In the end, the day was not a waste. Of course I overreacted, as I am prone to do. I did a little bit of reading while Miss E napped. At night I did a little bit of writing. I wrote a page. One page. Not bad. I know I need to handle these disruptions better and not lose my jinkies at a moment&#8217;s notice. But the truth is, I love my routine. It is comforting. I feel at ease when I look at the clock and know what’s the next thing I have to do. It gives me a sense of control over my life. At this stage in my life, where a lot of things are a big question mark&#8211;one of them being “how the f*%k am I going to pay my bills next month???”&#8211;my work routine is something I can rely on. it is something I can do on a regular basis and see results quickly&#8230;unlike, say, applying for jobs.

On an unrelated note: if you want to help keep me focused on my dissertation and not on my bills situation, donations are accepted.
