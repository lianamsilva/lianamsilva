My time as Graduate Writing Specialist is coming to an end in a few weeks, as I have mentioned in my [Altac Chronicles][1]. However, I am still committed to helping out the graduate students at my school. Even though the next two weeks are mostly dedicated to writing reports and leaving instructions to whoever replaces me, I still get requests for help.

This is also the time of the year where I get lots of requests from graduate students for me to read dissertations or theses. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I would do it if I could. But I am not a personal Writing Consultant; I am a Programming Associate, and I have a lot of other responsibilities that I have to balance on a daily basis. I simply do not have the time to read a whole dissertation chapter, let alone a dissertation. But it breaks my heart to tell students I can&#8217;t help them; often times these are students who have been writing from afar, or who have only recently discovered the Writing Center, or who think that I, the Graduate Writing Specialist, am the person they were looking for all along: someone who can sit down and comb through every page and give them feedback.

At moments like that, when a student is weeks (or days!) away from their dissertation defense or from a major deadline, I send them our writing center&#8217;s list of Professional Editors, knowing full well that some of them cannot afford to hire an editor full time. Because they can&#8217;t afford an editor and because our services are free (and rightfully so) they wonder who in our office can read their whole dissertation chapter. But we work by appointments, and a consultant cannot read a chapter in one sitting&#8211;it&#8217;s something that none of us at the Writing Center can accomplish in one hour.

For this reason, last Thursday I inquired on Twitter and on my personal Facebook page about where graduate students and ex-graduate students found writing support. Advisors can&#8217;t do it all, even if they tell themselves they can (or they should), even if students don&#8217;t know any other option other than their advisor. So where do students go?

  * Many go about it alone. One even jokingly asked what this thing called &#8220;writing support&#8221; was. Funny and sad at the same time.
  * Others had a friend or peer who would do them the favor of reading their work. Some would exchange documents with a peer and pay them back by giving them feedback. This is a common system, but not sustainable when, say, one of the writers has a deadline coming up and they don&#8217;t have the time to offer feedback to their writer.
  * Ask for help online. The ones who suggested this were folks who I know are active on Twitter.
  * Advisors. These are the de facto sources of writing feedback, but are they necessarily a form of writing support? I&#8217;m not being facetious, but genuinely curious.
  * Writing groups. These are harder to come by because it&#8217;s more about fit than department, but in my experience they are very helpful!
  * Mentors. Another group who works from the goodness of their heart and who oftentimes offer support even if it is not in their job description.

My takeaway from this brief, informal survey of colleagues, friends, and family was that there are many sources of writing support,  but that there are still many who don&#8217;t know where to go to to find someone who will read long documents. I even heard from two people who mentioned that the writing centers they&#8217;ve interacted with have not been helpful. If the writing center is the place to have conversations about writing and writers cannot count on us, how *can *we better serve the graduate student population?
