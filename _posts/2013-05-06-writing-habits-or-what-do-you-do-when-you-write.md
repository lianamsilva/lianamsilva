I have (or *had*) a nice little writing routine up until recently. I would wake up around 5:00 am on a workday, drag myself out of bed, turn on my laptop, and get to work on whatever writing project I had on the docket. Sometimes it was a blog post, sometimes it was editing an article, sometimes it was commenting on a writer&#8217;s post, and sometimes it was just me waiting for inspiration to strike as I read my Twitter feed in the wee hours of the morning. It&#8217;s a routine I picked up when I was working on the dissertation; I would wake up early to write or read because a) I had to go to work at 8 b) I wanted to write before my daughter woke up. Although I was more of a night owl when I started graduate school, (almost) steady work hours and a toddler have turned me into a morning person.

The flip side? I&#8217;m pretty useless when it comes to creativity in the evening. Sure, I&#8217;ve written the occasional blog post after my daughter has gone to sleep, struck by an acute desire to say something to the (online) world, or I&#8217;ve sat down to edit a piece because I had a deadline coming up&#8211;I&#8217;m so good with deadlines&#8211; but I no longer can sit down and be productive at night, especially with my commute and with an energetic toddler who hasn&#8217;t seen me all day.

Mornings are my creative time. However, lately I&#8217;ve been having trouble waking up early to write. I&#8217;m doing double-duty at home, and so when the alarm goes off at 5:00, sometimes I hit snooze and I just go back to sleep. Sure, I feel like that a lot of mornings, but nowadays I&#8217;m really exhausted and I don&#8217;t have it in me to fight back the sleep. (I&#8217;ve also become very good at falling asleep on the couch, no matter what I&#8217;m wearing or what&#8217;s going on around me. I try not to sit on the couch until my daughter is asleep or unless it&#8217;s a weekend. I&#8217;m only half-joking.)

I&#8217;m trying to be kind to The Writer Inside Me and recognize that it&#8217;s not easy to keep the old modes of production going when the circumstances have changed. I just try again the next day or work on drafts in spurts. Getting [a writing buddy][1] to help me make progress on the article I&#8217;m supposed to be working on has also helped. She reminds me that the writing process need not be riddled with guilt, and that I should give myself credit for all I have done with everything I have going on.

So instead of rethinking my routine, I&#8217;ve been thinking about habits. What are my writing habits? How do they help? Can I add new habits? *Should *I add new habits? I&#8217;d like to know from you, reader: **what are your writing habits? what are some things you feel you need to do every time you sit down and write?**
