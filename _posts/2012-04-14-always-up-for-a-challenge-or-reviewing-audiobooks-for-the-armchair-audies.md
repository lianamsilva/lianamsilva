    Even though I am not out of the dissertation race just yet (just a few more weeks, folks!), I am already itching for something new to work on. A month ago I came across a tweet from Jen at <a href="http://literatehousewife.com/">The Literate Housewife</a>, who was looking for bloggers to review audiobooks for The Armchair Audies. The Armchair Audies is basically a reading challenge where bloggers from around the web review the nominations within a category of the <a href="http://www.theaudies.com/">Audies</a>, awards for audiobooks. Because I commute thrice a week to work, and because I <em>still </em>haven&#8217;t fixed my radio, I started listening to audiobooks on my iPhone to keep me entertained on my hour-long trip. I thought this challenge would be a nice way to find new audiobooks to check out. The category I have chosen to review is the Biography/Memoir category; it seems the genre I gravitate towards lately is biographies read by the authors, but only three of the five books nominated are read by their authors. Let&#8217;s see how it goes.

        I&#8217;m looking forward to reviewing these nominees and making my predictions, especially because this is actually my first time reviewing audiobooks!
