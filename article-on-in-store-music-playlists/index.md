I am currently doing research for an article on the music that retail stores play while customers shop. Although some articles focus on studies about what kinds of music affect customers&#8217; shopping habits, my research is focused on how the music is selected: genres, artists, remixes, etc. I wonder: are there certain genres that get more airplay in certain stores? Why is that?Â On a broader scale, my aim is to write a snapshot of contemporary cultural history.
