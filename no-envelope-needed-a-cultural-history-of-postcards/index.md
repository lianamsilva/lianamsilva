I am currently working on a Tumblr called [No Envelope Necessary][1], where I post pictures and articles related to postcards. I&#8217;ve been collecting quirky and fun postcards since I moved to Upstate New York in 2004. The Tumblr is the beginning of a writing project that I conceive of as a cultural history of postcards.
